# Hints

Hints mode puts a short label on the useful text in the focused pane. Type a
label to copy the text. It works like tmux-fingers and the kitty hints kitten.

## Use it

1. Press `Ctrl+B F`. The labels show and the rest of the pane goes dim.
2. Type a label. dartuios copies the text and closes hints mode.

| Keys | What it does |
|---|---|
| a label, such as `a` or `ls` | Copy the text |
| the label with `Shift`, such as `A` | Copy the text and type it into the pane |
| the label with `Ctrl`, such as `Ctrl+A` | Open a URL or a path |
| `backspace` | Remove the last letter you typed |
| `esc`, or the leader key | Close hints mode |
| `q` | Close hints mode, when `q` is not a label letter |
| `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+G` | Close hints mode, when `c` or `g` is not a label letter |

The nearest text to the cursor gets the shortest label. The same text gets the
same label every time it shows. A key that starts no label does nothing.

When `c` or `g` is a label letter, `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+G` open that label like
any other `Ctrl` and label. `g` is in the default letters, so `Ctrl+G` opens
the label `g`. Use `esc` to close. The leader key always closes hints mode,
also when it is `Ctrl` and a label letter.

Hints mode keeps all input from the pane while the labels show. dartuios drops a
paste, and it drops a key release and a mouse move over the pane. A mouse
click or the mouse wheel closes hints mode first and then works as usual.
Hints mode also closes when its pane closes, when the focus moves to a
different pane, and when you change the workspace.

`Shift` and a label types the text. A terminal that reports Caps Lock (the
kitty keyboard protocol) lets dartuios read an upper case letter from Caps Lock
as a plain label letter. In a terminal that does not report Caps Lock, turn
Caps Lock off before you type a label.

The copy uses the same path as a mouse copy. dartuios writes the clipboard with
OSC 52, and on a local client also with the system clipboard tool.

You can also open hints mode from the command palette: search for `hints`.

## What hints mode finds

| Name | Examples |
|---|---|
| `url` | `https://example.com/a`, `git@github.com:user/repo.git` |
| `path` | `/etc/hosts`, `./run.sh`, `~/notes.md`, `main.go:12:5` |
| `diff` | The file in `diff --git a/x b/x`, `--- a/x`, and `modified: x` |
| `sha` | `149c8a8f`, a full 40-character hash |
| `ip` | `10.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.1.2:8080`, `fe80::1` |
| `uuid` | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` |
| `color` | `#1e1e2e`, `#fa0` |
| `hex` | `0xdeadbeef` |
| `number` | Numbers of 4 digits or more |
| `email` | `ops@example.com` |
| `id` | `pod/web-1`, `deployment.apps/web`, pod names, `sha256:` digests |

`path` and `email` accept letters in all scripts, with accents and
combining marks. The other built-in patterns use only ASCII.

Hints mode reads only the text on the screen. If you scroll the pane back, it
reads the lines you scrolled to. A URL that wraps onto the next row is one
match. dartuios joins two rows only when the terminal wrapped the text. A line
that fills the row and then ends is not joined to the next line. Both
terminal backends record the wrap, and the record goes with the text when
you attach again or change the workspace. On the ghostty backend, the wrap
from the newest history row into the first screen row is not restored, so
dartuios reads that row as a line that ends. A daemon from before this change
sends no wrap record, and dartuios then reads every restored row as a line
that ends.

## Open

`Ctrl` and a label opens the text:

- A URL opens in your browser. A remote client (`dartuios ssh`, the web client)
  copies the URL. It cannot open a browser on your machine.
- A path or a `file://` URL opens in a new pane with `$EDITOR`. dartuios removes
  a `:line:col` at the end. A relative path starts in the pane's directory.
- Other text is copied.

dartuios opens a file only when the file is on this machine. It copies the path
and tells you why in these cases:

- The pane runs on another machine.
- The session runs on another machine (`dartuios attach` to a host).
- The client is remote (`dartuios ssh`, the web client).
- The pane runs `ssh`, `autossh`, `mosh`, `et`, `telnet`, `tsh`, `kitten`
  (for example `kitten ssh`), `docker`, `kubectl` or `podman`.
- The shell reported a folder on another machine.
- The path is relative and a program runs in front of the shell. dartuios knows
  only the folder the shell reported, and the program can be somewhere else.
- The path is relative and dartuios does not know the pane's folder.

dartuios never gives the text to a shell. It gives the text to the opener as one
argument. Only `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `ftp` and `ftps` URLs open.

## Settings

Put the settings in `config.toml`:

```toml
[hints]
# Built-in patterns: "all", "none", or names such as "url,path,sha".
builtins = "all"
# More patterns, as Go regular expressions. A group named "match"
# sets the part that is copied.
patterns = ['JIRA-\d+', 'branch: (?P<match>\S+)']
# The letters of the labels, easiest first. Lowercase letters only.
alphabet = "asdfghjkl"
# Let Ctrl and a label open the text.
open = true
# How much the text around the labels dims, in percent (10 to 90).
dim = 60
```

Your own patterns come before the built-in patterns. dartuios warns about a
pattern that does not compile when it reads the config, and hints mode skips
that pattern.

`hints.builtins`, `hints.alphabet`, `hints.open` and `hints.dim` are also on
the settings page (Selection tab) and work with `dartuios set-config`.
`hints.patterns` is a list, so you set it in the file.

If your config already binds `F` in `[keybindings.prefix_mode]` to a
different action, dartuios keeps your binding and gives `hints` no key.
`dartuios keybinds doctor` tells you this. To use a different key, bind the
`hints` action:

```toml
[keybindings.prefix_mode]
hints = ["f"]
```
