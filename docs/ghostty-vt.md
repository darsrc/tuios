# The ghostty emulator backend

dartuios has two terminal emulator implementations behind one interface
(`vt.Terminal`), selected at build time:

- **Pure Go** (default): `internal/vt`'s own emulator. `go install` works
  with no toolchain, `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation works, nothing
  changes.
- **libghostty-vt** (`-tags ghostty`): parsing and grid state run inside
  [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)'s battle-tested VT
  library through the official Go bindings
  (`go.mitchellh.com/libghostty`). Release artifacts named `-ghostty` are
  built this way.

Exactly one implementation is compiled into a binary. The two never run
together in one process; comparing them is the differential harness's job
(`internal/vt/ghostty_differential_test.go`,
`internal/session/ghostty_wire_test.go`), which feeds identical bytes to
both and asserts screens, cursor, scrollback, modes and wire snapshots
agree.

## Installing a local build

`scripts/install.sh` goes from a checkout to a `dartuios` on your PATH, and runs
from any directory. With `ghostty`, it builds the pinned library if that has
not happened yet and passes `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` itself.

```sh
./scripts/install.sh            # the pure Go emulator (default)
./scripts/install.sh ghostty    # ghostty backend
```

The default destination is `~/.local/bin`; override it with `--prefix DIR`
or `$DARTUIOS_PREFIX`. Both backends install under the same name, so switching
between them is one run of the script with the other name.

Two things the script warns about, because either one makes a successful
install look like it did nothing:

- **Another `dartuios` earlier on your PATH** shadowing what was just
  installed. A `go install`ed binary in `~/go/bin` is the usual culprit.
- **A running daemon**, which keeps serving the build it started from until
  it is stopped. Pass `--kill-server` to have the script run
  `dartuios kill-server` for you, or `--keep-server` to be told and left alone;
  with neither, it asks. Stopping the daemon ends the programs in your panes;
  each session's layout and working directories are saved on the way out and
  come back with new shells when the daemon next starts.

Because the two builds install under one name, the binary is the only thing
that can say which emulator it carries, and `dartuios --version` does:

```
dartuios version dev [ghostty backend]
Commit: 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
Built: 2026-08-22T13:41:07Z
By: install.sh
```

The backend name comes from the build tag, not from anything the script
injects, so it cannot disagree with what was compiled. The commit is stamped
by the script because the stamps the go command embeds name the main
checkout's HEAD when the build runs in a linked worktree.

## Building with the tag

The script wraps this; run it directly when you want the build without the
install.

```sh
./scripts/ghostty-lib.sh            # needs zig >= 0.16; caches in .ghostty-vt/
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/.ghostty-vt/native/pkgconfig" go build -tags ghostty ./...
```

`ghostty-lib.sh` pins the ghostty commit; bumping it is a deliberate
change, reviewed like a dependency bump, and `go.mod` pins the binding
commit to match. It also pins the CPU to baseline: the archive is cached
across CI runners and linked into release binaries, so tuning it for the
machine that built it earns a SIGILL on the machine that runs it. What SIMD
survives is in simdutf and highway, which pick their kernel at runtime.
Cross targets: pass a zig target triple
(`x86_64-windows-gnu`, `aarch64-macos`, ...). Linux and Windows artifacts
cross-compile from Linux with zig as the C compiler; darwin builds run
natively on a macOS runner in the release workflow because Apple's SDK
does not cross-compile cleanly.

## Architecture

`GhosttyTerminal` (`internal/vt/ghostty_*.go`) owns what dartuios needs on
top of the library:

- **Stream scanner** (`ghostty_scan.go`, pure Go, unit-tested without
  cgo): tokenizes the PTY stream once, forwards everything to the
  library, and intercepts what dartuios owns: kitty APC and sixel DCS
  (withheld; dartuios's passthrough pipeline is their only consumer, and
  forwarding sixel would render it twice), OSC 52/4/104/10/11/12
  (answered Go-side so the library cannot answer queries a second time),
  OSC 66 text sizing, OSC 133 semantic markers, and the CSI/ESC
  dispatches whose state the library keeps but does not expose (DECSTBM
  values, charset designations, the kitty keyboard stack).
- **Shadow grid**: a uv-typed copy of the viewport, refreshed from the
  render state's dirty rows on the first read after a write. Each cell
  costs one Go memory read: the packed cell layout is decoded using the
  manifest the library publishes at runtime (`TypeJSON`), never
  hardcoded, with cgo getters as the fallback. Only grapheme clusters,
  hyperlinks and style-cache misses call into the library.
- **Snapshot restore**: the `Restore*`/`SetCell` family used by daemon
  reattach buffers everything and flushes as one synthesized VT stream in
  a canonical order, so it does not depend on `ApplyTerminalState`'s call
  order. Painted rows never run through the last column: the library
  would treat them as wrapped logical lines and reflow them into each
  other on the next resize.
- **Query answering**: DA1 is configured to answer exactly what the pure
  emulator answers; CPR/DSR/DECRQM come from the library itself through
  the `WritePty` callback into the same response pipe.

## Accepted divergences

Two are tracked in `TestGhosttyKnownDivergences`; each entry names which
side is right, and an entry that starts agreeing fails the test until it is
deleted.

- SGR `4:7`, an underline style no standard defines: the library falls back to
  a single underline, the pure emulator leaves the underline off, as tmux does.
  Neither is wrong by any specification.
- SGR `1;38;0`, colour type 0: the library reads the 0 as SGR 0 and resets the
  bold, the pure emulator consumes it as the colour type, as xterm and tmux
  do. The pure emulator is right.

The pure emulator now reads SGR 21 as a double underline, as the library does,
so that entry is gone. These differ by design and have no entry:

- Resize semantics: the library reflows wrapped lines and moves rows
  between screen and history; the pure emulator clips. Both are valid
  terminal behaviors; the reflow is what Ghostty itself does.
- `SetScrollbackMaxLines` after construction is a no-op on the library
  backend (the limit is a construction option).
- The pen's open OSC 8 hyperlink is not carried across a wire snapshot
  (cell hyperlinks are).
- Grapheme clustering (DEC mode 2027) is set by default on both backends,
  and RIS keeps it set. The library's own default is off, which gives a ZWJ
  family or a flag one cell per codepoint; the host terminal draws the same
  bytes as one two-column glyph, so the row and the pane border shifted.
  A program that resets 2027 turns clustering off in the library only: the
  pure emulator always places by grapheme width. Pinned by
  `TestGhosttyGraphemeClusteringDefault`.

## Blast radius

The emulator runs inside the daemon, so this is the part to be honest
about: a Go panic in the pure emulator is also fatal to the daemon, but
it produces a stack and dies cleanly; a memory fault inside the C library
is a SIGSEGV that cannot be recovered and takes every session with it.
Three things bound that risk:

- The library is the same code Ghostty ships to production terminals,
  fuzzed and exercised far beyond what `internal/vt` sees.
- `FuzzGhosttyTerminalWrite` fuzzes dartuios's own cgo boundary: arbitrary
  bytes in adversarial chunkings through the full adapter path,
  interleaved with reads and resizes.
- Every path that reaches the library checks for a concurrent Close
  after taking the adapter lock, so teardown cannot race a reader into
  freed memory.

What it buys: the conformance classes the pure emulator keeps paying for
(CPR transposition, SO/SI, IRM, margins) cannot regress here, and the
parser is 1.6x faster on full-screen truecolor repaints, 2.7x on
editor-style redraws and 15x on plain scroll at the emulator level
(`BenchmarkBackend*`, which runs against whichever backend the build
selected). Running the real DOOM-fire game in a pane: ~260 fps pure,
~330 fps ghostty on the same machine.
