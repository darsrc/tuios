// It is the SSH twin of checkTransportSecurity in cmd/dartuios-web, and it is
// deliberately the same shape. That command refuses a non-loopback bind with no
// TLS and names --auto-tls, --cert or --insecure; this one refuses a
// non-loopback bind with no keys and names an authorized_keys file or
// --no-auth. Both share netutil.IsLoopbackHost, so neither can decide an
// address is local while the other decides it is not.
//
// Nothing here asks a question first, for the reason the web command gives: a
// prompt would make the same command do different things depending on whether
// stdout is a terminal, and a server is started by unit files at least as often
// as by hand.

  %s is not this machine, and every connection to dartuios gets a shell on this
  machine. With no authentication that shell goes to anyone who reaches port
  %s. So pick who you want to let in:

  1. The holders of a public key you name. This is the normal answer.

       mkdir -p %s
       cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> %s
       dartuios ssh --host %s --port %s

     dartuios reads %s first. When that file
     is absent it reads ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, so a machine that already
     accepts your key over ssh needs no new file.

  2. Yourself only, over a tunnel. dartuios stays on this machine and no key
     file is involved.

       dartuios ssh --port %s
       ssh -L %s:localhost:%s <this-machine>

     then run ssh -p %s localhost at the far end.

  3. Anyone at all. Only on a network you trust.

       dartuios ssh --host %s --port %s --no-auth
