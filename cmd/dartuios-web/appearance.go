// wezterm arrives with it nil, and of the 342 built-in tints thirteen name no
// selection colour and twelve of those name no cursor colour either.

// browserAppearance is how the page looks for this server.
//
// The title is always sent. It is not a colour, so no terminal has to settle
// it, and without one every dartuios tab says "Sip".
//
// The palette is sent only when the user picked a theme. With no theme dartuios
// leaves indexed colours indexed and the browser resolves them, which is the
// same contract a real terminal has, and theme.GetANSIPalette answers with
// ansi.BasicColor indices whose RGBA in this process is the xterm default:
// #800000 for red, #808000 for yellow. Those are a guess. Sending them would
// paint a browser with sixteen colours nobody chose, so an unthemed server
// sends no colour at all and sip keeps its own.
//
// Four of sip's settings are deliberately left alone. CursorStyle and
// CursorBlink are the browser's defaults and dartuios overrides both at runtime
// with DECSCUSR, so a value here would only decide the first frame. FontSize
// belongs to the reader, who has a slider for it. Scrollback is sip's browser
// buffer, and dartuios repaints the whole screen: the lines above it are stale
// frames, and the scrollback a user browses is dartuios's own, inside the pane.
//
// This blob travels once, at the handshake. A theme the user changes while a
// browser is attached reaches the panes, because dartuios resolves indexed
// colours itself, but not the browser's own palette, cursor or page ground.
// Those follow on the next page load.
