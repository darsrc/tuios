Serves dartuios through the browser with full terminal emulation capabilities.
Powered by sip (github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/sip).

Server features:
  - Dual protocol support: WebTransport (HTTP/3 over QUIC) for low latency
    with automatic WebSocket fallback for broader compatibility
  - HTTPS from a self-signed certificate dartuios-web generates and keeps
    (--auto-tls), or from your own (--cert/--key). A bind to a LAN address
    requires one of them unless you opt into clear text with --insecure
  - Configurable host, port, read-only mode, and connection limits
  - All dartuios flags forwarded to spawned instances (theme, show-keys, etc.)
  - Structured logging with charmbracelet/log
  - Persistent sessions via daemon mode (default) with multi-client support

Client features:
  - WebGL-accelerated rendering via xterm.js for smooth 60fps output
  - Bundled JetBrains Mono Nerd Font for proper icon display
  - Settings panel for transport, renderer, and font size preferences
  - Cell-based mouse event deduplication reducing network traffic by 80-95%
  - requestAnimationFrame batching for efficient screen updates
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff`,
