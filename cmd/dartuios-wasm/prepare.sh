# Prepares the module setup for a js/wasm build without touching go.mod, and
# prints the path of the modfile to pass to go build with -modfile.
#
# Two dependencies do not compile for js/wasm as released, so this copies each
# out of the module cache into .wasm-build/ and patches the copy:
#
#   charm.land/bubbletea/v2  has TTY and signal files for unix and windows
#                            only. The copy gets stubs/bubbletea_tty_js.go.in
#                            as tty_js.go. Upstream: charmbracelet/bubbletea
#                            issue 1410. Drop this half once a release builds
#                            for js.
#   github.com/creack/pty    (under xpty) has no js files, so its unix files
#                            are picked up and fail on missing ioctls. The copy
#                            treats js the way it treats windows: every call
#                            reports ErrUnsupported. The browser build never
#                            opens a pty (panes run on internal/webshell), so
#                            nothing reaches those calls. Drop this half once
#                            creack/pty or xpty builds for js.
#
# go.mod and go.sum are never changed: the replace directives go into a copy,
# .wasm-build/go.wasm.mod, which only the browser build reads.
