// dartuios keeps painting for seconds after a flooding program has exited. This
// measures that tail on a real client.
//
// The flood has to be one that costs the client something to show. A stream of
// numbered lines does not: the daemon's own emulator paces the guest, the
// client keeps up with it byte for byte, and when the writer dies the pane
// stops in the same instant. Measured that way the tail is zero and there is
// nothing to fix, which is the wrong answer.
//
// A DOOM fire is the flood that was reported, and what makes it different is
// that every frame repaints every cell with its own colour. Those bytes are
// cheap to produce and expensive to parse and to draw, so the client falls
// behind and the queue between them fills with frames nobody will ever see.
//
// Each frame carries its own number, so the highest number on screen says which
// frame the client is showing. The gap between the number at the writer's death
// and the number it settles on is the backlog, in frames, that the client
// painted for nobody.

// same test can be pointed at a more expensive compose path for comparison.
