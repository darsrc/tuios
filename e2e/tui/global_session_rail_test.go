// A session can hold a window whose process runs on another machine. The rail
// lists that window, so it has to say which machine it is on: a command typed
// into a pane does a different thing depending on which machine answers it,
// and the rail is where someone looks before typing.
//
// This is the whole path in one test, which is why it is here rather than only
// in the unit tests. The daemon puts the host on the window state, pushes it,
// the client adopts it onto its own window, the session tree carries it, and
// the row draws it. A break anywhere along that chain is a row that silently
// says nothing, and nothing below the top of it would fail.
