// Issue #123: a reattached pane comes back with blank rows where a full-screen
// program had drawn.
//
// The reported steps do not reach it. What does is a pane whose output the
// daemon's own emulator cannot keep up with. The daemon reads the PTY into a
// 64 KB catch-up ring and feeds its emulator from a second goroutine, so under
// a flood the emulator's position (vtSeq) trails the ring's head. A client
// attaching then gets a snapshot taken at the emulator's position, and by the
// time it subscribes the ring has rolled past it. That is a "rolled" catch-up.
//
// A rolled catch-up used to open with a clear (\x1b[H\x1b[2J\x1b[3J), so the
// replayed tail would paint against a known screen instead of splicing onto a
// half-stale one. For a client that drew its screen byte by byte that is right.
// For a client that has just laid down a snapshot it is wrong: the snapshot is
// already the whole stream up to that point, and the clear throws away exactly
// the rows the ring no longer holds.
//
// This test builds that shape with a real binary in a real PTY. The pane draws
// a header once, then floods rows below it forever with per-cell colour, which
// is cheap to produce and expensive to parse. The header is only ever in the
// snapshot: it left the ring millions of bytes ago and the flood never
// addresses those rows. Detach, reattach at a different width, and the header
// must still be there.
//
// The body carries its own marker, and the test waits for that marker before it
// reads the header. That separates the failure this is about (the pane is live,
// the header is gone) from a pane that is simply blank or dead, which would
// otherwise pass for the same thing.
//
// Negative controls, both confirmed to fail here as assertions:
//   - internal/session/session.go, put the guard back to plain `rolled`
//   - internal/app/session.go, pass false instead of fromSeq > 0
