// A link that drops under an attached session, on screen.
//
// The report this file exists for, in the maintainer's words: "the ssh
// connection is not very reliable btw, i connected to oci and it keeps dropping
// and it very rudely just switches off from the terminal i was working on".
// Two failures. The link dropped, and the client answered by closing every pane
// and putting him back on his own machine.
//
// The second is what these tests hold. The daemon on the host owns the session
// and is still running it, so a dropped pipe is this client's problem to solve,
// not the person's. What must happen: the pane stays on screen, the dock says
// the link is being dialed again, and the session comes back with its content
// and with the place in the history the person was reading.
//
// Everything here goes through the real transport. The ssh stand-in drops
// ssh's options and runs the command locally with the far machine's XDG
// directories, so `ssh build dartuios stdio-proxy` reaches a second real daemon
// over a real pipe. No network is used and nothing reads the developer's ssh
// configuration.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS are recorded in NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md and in the report for
// this change. Each was run by mutating the shipped code and watching a named
// assertion fail.

// attachOnBuild starts a client on this machine, opens the rail and switches
