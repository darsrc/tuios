// the window width from lines[0] alone; the unfocused fast path right-trims
// every line and shared borders hand the compositor raw content, so an
// application with a blank top row measured zero columns wide. The guard
// x+windowWidth <= 0 was then true for the leftmost tile at x=0 and the whole
// frame was discarded, and the empty layer was cached and re-served forever.

// UNFOCUSED. An earlier version of this test only checked that the markers were
// on screen at some point during the cycle, and it passed against the broken
// binary, because focusing the pane rebuilds its layer and makes it correct
// again. Sampling only after a focus change is what makes this test evidence.
