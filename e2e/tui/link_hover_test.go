// Link hover is the first thing in dartuios drawn onto pane content from a pointer
// position, and the unit tests for it assert on renderTerminal's output. This
// asserts on the host's own grid, through a real PTY, because that is the level
// at which the recurring failure in this codebase lives: internal state and
// pixels disagreeing.
//
// It is also the only test that exercises the motion filter, the hover
// resolver, the cell loop and the compositor as one thing. Any of the four
// dropping the event produces the same visible result, which is the point.

// linkURL is printed as plain text, never through OSC 8, so this covers the
// case that matters in practice: a URL a program printed with no idea that
// anything would ever want to click it.
const linkURL = "https://example.com/e2e-link"

// findOnGrid returns the column and row of the first cell of want, or ok=false.
// It matches per physical row, so a URL that soft-wrapped is not found; the
// terminal is wide enough that it cannot.
//
// sidebar_test.go has findOnScreen, which fails the test when it finds nothing
// and takes a *Terminal. These tests need the answer rather than a failure (one
// of them asserts on where the run is not) and they need it against a snapshot
// they already hold, so that the cells they then read are the same frame the
// text was found in.
// It walks cells rather than searching Line's string, because the answer is a
// column and Index's answer is a byte offset. The two differ by two on every row
// of a pane, the border being one column of three bytes, and a cell read at the
// byte offset is then two cells to the right of the text that was found. That is
// far enough to move an assertion off a link and not far enough to look wrong.
