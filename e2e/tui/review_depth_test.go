// The review overlay's diff at each colour depth a terminal can have, on a
// dark terminal and under a light theme, in the unified and the split view.
//
// Below truecolor the diff's tints used to be stepped down one colour at a
// time by the frame writer, and an added line and a removed line both landed
// on the same grey (239 at 256 colours, bright black at 16): only the sign
// column still told them apart. The diff is designed per depth instead:
//
//   - truecolor: the designed tints, an added and a removed line on grounds of
//     their own.
//   - 256 colours: fixed palette entries, the ones Codex uses. On a dark ground
//     an added line is 22 and a removed one 52, with the changed words one step
//     brighter on 28 and 88; on a light ground 194 and 224, with the words on
//     157 and 217.
//   - 16 colours: no line grounds at all. The line numbers are in green for an
//     added line and red for a removed one, the changed words are bold and
//     underlined, and the cursor is reverse video on the gutter only, so the
//     code keeps its colours and its marks under it.
//
// Each frame is saved as text, as styled text and as a PNG drawn by dartuios's
// own renderer (internal/shot), with the palette a terminal of that kind
// paints the sixteen slots with.

// reviewDepthBase is the file the fan's base commit holds; reviewDepthNew is
// what the second attempt changes it to. Between them: a removed line with no
// counterpart (the const), a changed line whose changed words are marked (the
// return), and an added line with no counterpart (the second Println).

// TestReviewDiffAtEveryColourDepth opens the review of a changed Go file under
// each colour depth, on a dark terminal and under a light theme, in the
// unified and the split view, and holds the diff to what the depth is
// designed to show (see the comment at the top of this file).
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - The profile could be ignored and every run drawn in truecolor. The 256
//     runs require exact palette indices and the 16 runs default grounds,
//     which truecolor never writes.
//   - A cell could be read off a stale frame, or off the file list rather than
//     the diff. Every line is found by text only the diff shows, and the split
//     view is waited for by the footer key only it offers.
//   - An added and a removed line could still share a ground and pass because
//     each is checked alone. They are compared to each other, and at 16
//     colours their line numbers must be in different slots.
//   - At 16 colours the changed words could be marked by a ground the frame
//     writer happened to keep. Every code cell is required to be on the
//     default ground, and the words to be bold and underlined while the rest
//     of the line is not underlined.
//   - At 16 colours the cursor could reverse the whole row, which drops the
//     code's colours and hides the changed words' mark. The cursor is moved
//     onto the changed line and only its gutter may be reversed.
//
// Negative controls are in NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md.
