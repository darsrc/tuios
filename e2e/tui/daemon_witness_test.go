// The daemon-side witness.
//
// # Why a witness is needed at all
//
// Everything an attached client shows is a copy. The original lives in the
// daemon, which owns each pane's emulator and hands a client a byte stream to
// replay into its own. Every assertion that reads only the client's screen is
// therefore asking the copy whether it agrees with itself, and a copy always
// does.
//
// That split is where the worst bugs of the month lived, and docs/REHYDRATION.md
// is the audit of them. What reaches the screen when a route gets it wrong is
// two stretches of one pane's output, far apart in time, adjacent on the glass:
// a stream replayed across a hole, or the same lines painted twice at a seam.
// Nothing a client-only check looks at is wrong in that state. The process is
// alive, the grid is the right size, every pane holds plausible text, and the
// pane is a lie.
//
// # What the witness is
//
// The daemon's own answer to the same question, read through the verbs a user
// already has: capture-pane for a pane's grid and its scrollback, list-windows
// and session-info for the structure. The daemon renders those from its own
// emulator and never from an attached client, so it is an independent observer
// of the same state rather than a second look at the same buffer.
//
// docs/REHYDRATION.md names that emulator the authority for grid, cursor, modes
// and scrollback, on the grounds that it is the only thing that has seen every
// byte, and its feed now blocks rather than dropping a chunk when it falls
// behind. That is what makes it usable as a witness for content and not only for
// structure, and it is why the rules below read it as ground truth.
//
// # Which of that document's invariants these rules cover
//
// The contract states five, and this file is a partial oracle for three of them,
// asserted continuously under an arbitrary action stream rather than at the end
// of one named route:
//
//	2. Scrollback. The client may never hold history the daemon does not have.
//	   witness-provenance and client-ahead are that, bounded from both sides.
//	4. Modes. The alternate-screen flag matches. altscreen-retained is that.
//	5. No duplication. Content produced once appears once. The adjacency rule
//	   fires on a repeated number as readily as on a missing run, so a line
//	   painted twice at a seam breaks it.
//
// Invariant 1, cell-for-cell grid equality, and invariant 3, the cursor, are
// asserted far better by TestRehydrationMatrix in internal/app, which runs a
// daemon in process and compares emulators directly. Restating them here against
// a screen scrape would be slower and less certain about the same property. What
// this file adds is that its three run after every action of a fuzz stream,
// through a real PTY and the real binding table, in states nobody chose.
//
// Scroll position is deliberately absent. The contract says it is where a viewer
// is looking rather than a property of the pane, and that it is not preserved on
// the routes that rebuild windows. A rule about it here would report the design.
//
// # Witness lines
//
// A pane is asked to print numbered lines, "MK<tag>-<n>", one per line, with n
// counting up forever per pane. Two properties fall out of that and they are
// what the oracle is built on.
//
// Adjacency: two witness lines that sit on adjacent rows must carry adjacent
// numbers. A spliced stream breaks it and almost nothing else does, because
// clipping a pane removes whole rows from the top or the bottom, an overlay
// covers a run of rows, and a partly hidden pane loses a run of rows. All of
// those separate the surviving lines by at least one non-witness row, so the
// rule simply declines to compare them. It needs no knowledge of where a pane
// is, how big it is, or what is on top of it, which is what makes it safe to run
// after every single action.
//
// Provenance: a number on the client must be one the daemon actually has. The
// client showing MKab01-12 while the daemon's grid holds 400..423 is the client
// rendering something the daemon has forgotten, which is the stale half of a
// splice even when the visible run happens to be self-consistent.
//
// The command that prints them is written so its own echo cannot be mistaken for
// output: the shell shows `printf 'MKab01-%d\n' $(seq ...)`, and "%d" is not a
// run of digits, so the format string never matches the pattern its output does.

// witnessRe matches one witness line. The tag is the first four characters of
// the window's uuid, which makes a line self-identifying without the reader
// having to know which pane it is looking at.

// altMarkerIn reports whether grid holds the single line paneAltCmd paints on
// the alternate screen for the pane tagged tag. It is deliberately a different
// shape from a witness line: the alternate screen has no scrollback and shares
// none of its content with the main one, so a rule about it must not be
// satisfiable by a main-screen line. The main screen never holds the letters
// either, because the command that paints them is echoed as octal escapes.
//
// A marker cut short on the right still counts. The alternate screen does not
// reflow, so a pane that was ever narrower than the marker keeps only the
// columns that fitted, and "ALT2736" is that pane's marker, not another's.
