// TestLightThemeRailAndDockAreReadable attaches under catppuccin_latte, a
// light theme, with the shipped looks: the rail on the right and the dock on
// top. Neither paints a ground, so their text is written on the theme's own
// near-white background. The rail's session names and the dock's notice were
// drawn in the dark ramp's near-white inks there, at about 1.1:1, which is
// text nobody can read. Each is measured against the ground here and has to
// clear the text floor. The frame is saved under artifactDir.
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - A name could be matched in the dock or a pane instead of the rail, so
//     the rail's names are looked for right of the rail's divider only.
//   - A cell left in the terminal's default colour cannot be measured, and it
//     reads by definition, so the check needs the cells to carry a colour:
//     the client is told the terminal has truecolor, and a default cell on the
//     measured text fails as "not measured" rather than passing.
//   - The frame could be read before the dock's notice is drawn, and a
//     missing notice would then be skipped. Each probe fails when its text
//     is not on screen.
//
// Negative control: with GroundUI returning UI unchanged, all three probes
// measure 1.09:1 and fail.
