// Liveness.
//
// The fuzzer proves dartuios does not violate its invariants. It does not prove
// dartuios does anything. Every rule in both oracles is a prohibition, and a client
// that rendered an empty screen forever and accepted every keystroke into a void
// would satisfy nearly all of them: nothing would be spliced, no pane would
// disagree with the daemon, no grid would be the wrong size, nothing would
// panic. The one existing rule with any positive content is the size check, and
// a blank screen is the right size.
//
// That is a structural gap rather than a gap in the rule set, so it cannot be
// closed by adding more prohibitions. What closes it is a small number of
// properties of the form "this eventually happens", each naming one thing dartuios
// is for.
//
// They are written as ordinary tests rather than as fuzz rules on purpose. A
// liveness property needs a known starting state to be worth anything: "typing
// shows the character" is only a claim if something is focused, in a mode that
// takes typing, and not covered by an overlay, and a fuzz run is in none of
// those states in particular. Asserted mid-run they would either be gated into
// vacuity or report the fuzzer's own wandering as a failure. Asserted here, each
// one fails exactly when the thing it names has stopped working.
//
// Each is also checked on both sides where both sides have an answer, because
// "eventually shows" has two halves: the daemon has to receive it and the client
// has to draw it, and a property that only checks one of those is half a claim.

// livenessSession is a client attached to a real daemon-backed session with one
// pane, settled in window-management mode.
