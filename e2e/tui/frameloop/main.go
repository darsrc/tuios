// Command frameloop stands in for a graphics app that fills its pane, in the
// way that matters to the passthrough: it asks the kernel how big its terminal
// is in pixels, renders a bitmap of exactly that size, and streams it through
// shared memory at a steady rate, reusing one image id.
//
// Guessing the pixel size instead is what makes a harness test something other
// than the reported scenario. A real app renders to the size it was given, so
// the image's pixels-per-cell agrees with the host's by construction, and any
// disagreement seen downstream is dartuios's own.
