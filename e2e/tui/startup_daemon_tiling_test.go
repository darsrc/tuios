// TestStartupTilingOnADaemonBuiltSession is the reported bug, end to end with
// the real binary: with startup.tiled on, attaching to a session the daemon
// already built comes up untiled.
//
// The session is made the way a user makes one before attaching to it, so it
// holds the window the daemon opened for it. That window is what used to make
// the [startup] settings look inapplicable: the session was not empty, so every
// one of them was skipped. Scrolling mode failed for a second reason on top of
// that: the client turned tiling on without telling the daemon, and the
// daemon's next state took it away again. That is why all three modes are
// driven here.

// TestStartupTilingOnANewSession is the reported bug in the shape the owner hit
// it: a session started fresh, which opens its default window through the
// client rather than the daemon.
//
// The window the client asks for is created by the daemon, and the daemon
// broadcasts the session back when it has made it. That broadcast carries
// AutoTiling as the daemon holds it, so a client that turned tiling on without
// telling the daemon has it turned straight off again a moment later. Only
// scrolling mode did that, because its branch of the toggle returned before the
// sync; the other two are here to show the shape is not mode-specific.
