// TestScrolledOutputRendersCorrectly runs a command whose output scrolls the
// pane many screens' worth and asserts the pane is coherent afterwards.
//
// Scrolling is the path where the emulator rewrites every line in the cell
// buffer, which is the same buffer the renderer walks and the resize path
// reallocates. Several of this session's blank-pane bugs surfaced as a pane
// that had scrolled and then rendered as empty cells or as a stale cached
// frame, so the assertion is not merely "dartuios survived": it is that the tail
// of the scrolled output is on screen, that the shell prompt came back, and
// that the pane still updates afterwards.
