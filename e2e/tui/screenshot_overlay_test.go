// The screenshot chord over an open overlay. The Inbox and the review own the
// keyboard while they are up, and they used to own the leader with it, so
// ctrl+b C did nothing and neither screen could be captured.
//
// How these could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - the capture might be of the screen after the overlay closed, so the file
//     is checked for the overlay's own text;
//   - capture mode's hint strip might be in the file, so the file is checked
//     for its absence;
//   - the chord might work by closing the overlay first, so the overlay is
//     checked to still be open after the preview closes;
//   - holding the leader for the chord might take the leader, or the key after
//     it, away from the overlay, so a leader followed by an ordinary key is
//     checked to still reach the overlay (the positive half).

// captureFullScreenOver opens capture mode with the leader chord while an
// overlay is up, takes the full screen with key (f or enter), waits for the
// file and returns what it holds. Capture mode must not offer a pane: the panes
// are under the overlay. The preview panel is closed with enter, which keeps the file.
//
// The host stream up to capture mode is saved as well, so the screen as dartuios
// drew it can be rendered to an image and looked at.
