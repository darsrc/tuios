// The report this file exists for: a local client attached to a daemon session
// and a second client (dartuios-web, in the report) attached beside it, a split
// open, and a plain pane switch (alt+n) resizes the panes. Nobody touched a
// window boundary.
//
// The chrome round settled the outer box (multiclient_chrome_test.go). What
// was left was the arithmetic inside it: shared borders and the pane gap were
// process-global config that nothing synced, so two clients whose configs
// disagreed partitioned the same box into different rectangles (or the same
// rectangles into different guest grids), and every state push dragged the
// shared PTYs between the two answers. The web client is exactly the second
// process with its own configuration in force.
//
// This test is the report's own sequence across two real dartuios processes with
// genuinely different config files. The web frontend itself cannot be driven
// by this harness; a second dartuios process with its own XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the
// faithful stand-in, because dartuios-web runs this same client code against the
// same daemon socket.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: measured against a binary built from the unfixed tree
// (20f17bbd, the build the report was filed against): the second client's
// attach alone moved the daemon's windows (the pane at 61,0 59x38 was dragged
// to 60,0 60x38, the config-less client reclaiming the divider column the
// shared-borders client had reserved), and the assertion on `joined` failed.
// Every later push re-fights the same argument, which is the report's
// "switching terminals triggers updates". On the fixed tree the geometry
// inputs are session state, the second client adopts them on attach, and
// nothing below moves a rectangle.
