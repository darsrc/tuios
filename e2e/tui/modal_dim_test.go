// The screen behind a modal overlay is dimmed (appearance.modal_dim), and the
// overlay itself is not. This drives the real binary at each colour depth, on
// a dark terminal with no theme and under a light theme, and reads the cells
// the terminal was sent.
//
// A pane prints three words: one in a truecolor ink, one in a 256-colour cube
// ink and one in ANSI red. With the palette open each has to come back quieter
// than it was, in the way the depth can draw it:
//
//   - truecolor and 256: a colour dartuios can read channels off (the truecolor
//     and cube inks, and under a theme the ANSI slot, which the theme defines)
//     moves toward its ground: darker on the dark terminal, lighter under the
//     light theme, whose scrim pulls toward its light surface. At 256 the new
//     colour is written as another index, measured on the xterm table.
//   - an ANSI slot with no theme is the user's own colour, which dartuios cannot
//     blend, and it goes faint instead.
//   - 16 colours: every word goes faint and keeps its colour.
//
// Then modal_dim is set to 0 with the palette still open. The words come back
// exactly as they were before it opened, and every cell of the palette is the
// same as it was with the dim on: the dim never reached the overlay. Closing
// the palette also puts the words back.
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - The palette might not be open when the cells are read: each read waits
//     for the palette's title, and the geometry comes from its own search rule.
//   - The words could be found in the echoed command line rather than the
//     output: the markers are built by the shell, so the command line does
//     not contain them.
//   - A cell could differ for another reason (the cursor, a blink): the words
//     sit on a line of their own, away from the prompt, and the comparison
//     with the dim off is made on the same open palette, not a reopened one.
//   - set-config might never reach the client, leaving the second read equal
//     to the first by accident: the second read waits until the words are
//     back to their undimmed cells, and fails if they never are.
//
// Every read is saved under artifactDir as text, styled text and a PNG drawn
// by dartuios's own renderer.
