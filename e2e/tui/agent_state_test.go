// TestAgentStateIndicatorRenders drives a real daemon: it sets a window's agent
// state through the set-agent-state verb (via the dartuios CLI, exactly as a pane's
// state-reporting shim would) and asserts the attached client renders the
// matching indicator in the window title.
//
// It is the end-to-end proof that the state model, the verb, the state sync, and
// the renderer are wired together: nothing in this test touches dartuios internals,
// only the CLI a shim uses and the screen a user sees.
//
// Negative control: against a binary without the feature, `dartuios set-agent-state`
// is an unknown subcommand (the CLI errors and this fails at the set step), and
// even if the call were a no-op no indicator would ever render, so the final wait
// would time out. Verified per NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md by pointing DARTUIOS_E2E_BIN at
// a pre-feature build.
