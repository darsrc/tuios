// TestKittyStretchWhileGuestLagsAResize is the reported stretch made
// deterministic.
//
// The bug is a race, and left to chance it shows up in roughly one run in
// three, which is how three fixes shipped for it and the report kept coming.
// The race is between the pane being given a new size and the guest getting
// round to drawing at it: for that interval dartuios holds the new cell count
// while every frame arriving is still the old bitmap. So both halves are held
// open here rather than waited for. The guest is told to take most of a second
// to relay out, the way a browser does, and the pane is resized by a mouse
// press that is never released. A press untiles a tiled pane, which drops its
// borderless allowance and hands the guest a box two cells smaller in each
// direction (internal/input/mouse_click.go, beginWindowDrag).
//
// What must not happen in that interval is a rescale. The pane is genuinely
// smaller and the bitmap is genuinely the old size, so there is only one honest
// thing to send: as much of the image as fits, at its own size. Sending all of
// it in fewer cells scales it, and scaling the width without the height is the
// stretched picture in the report.
