// TestRestoredPaneComesBackInItsDirectory is session restore bringing a pane
// back where its shell was, on every platform that can read another process's
// working directory: Linux through procfs and macOS through libproc.
//
// The daemon reads each shell's directory when it saves, because a shell does
// not have to announce one. The shell here is /bin/sh, which announces
// nothing over OSC 7, so the only way the restored pane can land in the
// directory is the daemon having read it from the process. The capture was
// Linux-only once, and every macOS restore then opened its panes wherever the
// daemon was started.
//
// The ways it could pass without testing that:
//   - The restored shell could start in the directory by accident. The
//     directory is one made for this test, and the daemon runs elsewhere.
//   - The line read could be the shell's echo of the command. The shell
//     answers through a format, so only its output has a line that is exactly
//     CWD-SAME or CWD-ELSEWHERE.
//   - The pane read could be the one from before the restart. The session is
//     checked to be marked restored first, which only a new daemon does.
//
// The pane's text before and after the restart is saved under artifactDir.
