// TestAWindowNameWinsOverAnIdPrefix: -w took a unique id prefix before an
// exact name, and a window id is a uuid, so a name made of hex digits is also
// a prefix of some other window's id now and then. A pane called "db" was
// missed about once in fifty runs of TestNarrowRailKeepsTheAgentNameBeforeItsHarness,
// which opens six panes: set-agent-state -w db reported success, the state
// went to the pane whose id happened to start with "db", and the pane called
// db stayed at none. It looked like a race because it came and went with the
// uuids the run drew. The list-windows reply is saved under artifactDir.
//
// This test makes the collision certain instead of waiting for it: the first
// pane is named after the start of the second pane's id.
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - The name could resolve to the named pane because the prefix matches
//     nothing, which proves nothing. The prefix is checked to match the other
//     pane and only it before the target is used.
//   - The state could land on both panes, or on neither with the verb failing
//     quietly. Both panes' states are read back, and the verb's exit is checked.
//   - The name could read as the index list-windows prints if it were all
//     digits and small, so a name that parses as an in-range index is refused
//     up front rather than silently tested on the wrong rule.
//   - The fix could be to stop taking id prefixes at all, which would pass
//     the first half. So the first pane is then renamed and the same prefix
//     must reach the other pane.
