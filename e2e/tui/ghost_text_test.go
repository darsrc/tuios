// TestGhostTextFramesArePresentedWhole is the regression test for ghost text: a
// line a full-screen guest was rewriting in place appeared on screen with stale
// characters woven through the new ones, while the lines around it were fine.
//
// The cause was not what dartuios computed but how it handed the frame over. The
// renderer writes only the cells that changed, so a frame is a cursor move and a
// run of characters; a host presenting partway through one shows the leading
// cells carrying the new text and the rest still carrying the old. On the
// reported line the changed cells were the spaces, so the tear read as junk
// sitting exactly where the spaces belonged. Every point inside an unbracketed
// frame is a tear waiting to be presented, and a busy neighbour pane keeps
// frames coming.
//
// bubbletea brackets frames in DEC 2026 itself, but only once the host answers a
// DECRQM query for the mode, and it never even asks over SSH or on Apple
// Terminal. dartuios now brackets its own frames, which does not depend on an
// answer.
//
// The assertion is on the bytes, not on a sampled screen. Sampling a host
// emulator asynchronously reports tears that were never presented, because a
// snapshot can land between two PTY reads of one frame; a byte stream in which
// every frame is bracketed cannot be presented torn at all.
//
// Negative control: against a build without the bracketing, every frame is
// wrapped in hide-cursor/show-cursor and carries no DEC 2026 at all, so the
// first assertion fails with 0 bracketed frames. Verified against the parent
// commit's binary.
