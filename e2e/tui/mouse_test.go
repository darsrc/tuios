//
// A wheel notch is a press and nothing else: SGR reports buttons 64 and 65 with
// the press final byte and never emits a matching release, because there is no
// button to let go of. That asymmetry is real, not a shortcut, so this is the

// release outside the loop. dartuios finishes a selection and writes the clipboard
// on release (internal/input.finishMouseSelection), so under the old shape a
// triple click generated exactly one clipboard write. The two intermediate
// releases a real triple click produces, and everything dartuios does on them,
// could not be generated at all, so no assertion could have observed them.
// TestDoubleClickCopiesAWordAndTripleClickTheLine now asserts on the whole
// sequence of writes rather than on whether the wanted text is somewhere in it.

//
// This exists because a test that sends three clicks is not thereby a test of
// what dartuios does with a triple click. A click joins the gesture in progress
// only if it arrives within internal/input.multiClickInterval of the last one,
// measured in dartuios at the moment it processes the press. The harness cannot
// control that: it can only put the bytes in the pty and hope dartuios is not
// busy. When it is, the third press lands outside the window, dartuios reads a
// double click followed by a single one, and everything it does afterwards is
// correct for the input it actually received. Asserting on the clipboard
// without checking that first conflates "the product mishandled a triple
// click", which must fail, with "the harness failed to deliver one", which
// means nothing.
//
// The highlight is what makes the difference visible, and it is a sound witness
// for the gesture because it is painted on the press: it is set before, and
// independently of, the clipboard write being asserted on, so reading it does
// not assume the answer. What it shows when a click falls outside the window is
// a shorter gesture. Losing the third press leaves nothing highlighted, because
// the stray single click starts a one-cell selection its own release finds
// empty and drops the implicit copy-mode session with it. Losing the second
// leaves the word highlighted, because the last two clicks are then a double
// click of their own. Both of those were observed while measuring this.
//
// One outcome cannot be told from a lost race by looking at a single gesture: a
// dartuios that selected the word on three clicks would paint exactly what a lost
// second press paints. Repetition separates them, and that is all the retry is
// for. A lost race is a coin flip that comes up differently on the next throw;
// a product that selects the wrong thing does it every time and fails on the
// last attempt with the span it painted in the message. So the retry is driven
// by a measured property of the gesture, never by a failed assertion, and it is
// bounded.
//
// Measured on a 16-core machine oversubscribed with 256 busy loops, which is
// the only way the race was made to happen at all: at the pacing this harness
// sends, 4 to 9 of every 100 triple clicks came out short. Idle, and with the
// machine merely busy rather than swamped, none of several hundred did.
