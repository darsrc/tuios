// The rail's file section lists a remote pane's files from the machine the
// pane is on.
//
// This is the whole chain and no part of it can be checked anywhere else. The
// far machine is asked where its process is, because nothing here can read a
// pid over there and bash announces nothing; the daemon that owns the window
// forwards the listing to that machine, because it does not have the files
// either; and the client draws what comes back.
//
// It failed in every one of those places at some point, and the last time it
// failed silently: the window's machine was wiped by the first client sync, so
// the daemon read the pane as local and listed its own disk for a path that
// only exists on the other one.
