// The negative control for the splice detector.
//
// A rule that has never been seen to fail is not known to be a rule. The
// campaign runs green, which is worth exactly nothing on its own: the same green
// is produced by a detector that returns "clean" unconditionally, and this
// suite has already had one assertion that could not have failed.
//
// This proves the detector rather than the plumbing, which is the honest limit
// of what a table test can do. Proving the plumbing needs a binary that really
// splices a stream, driven through DARTUIOS_E2E_BIN the way NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md
// describes for the rest of the suite.
//
// The cases that must not fire matter as much as the one that must. The rule
// runs after every action during a fuzz run, in states nobody chose, so a
// version of it that fired on a clipped pane or under an overlay would bury a
// real finding under thousands of false ones.

// hole at all once it is reading a composited screen through an emulator instead
// of a slice of strings the test built itself.
