// A placement fault that shows up "sometimes" is not going to be caught by one
// assertion after one action. Three fixes have shipped for this area on the
// strength of exactly that and the reports kept coming, so this runs the
// scenario continuously instead and checks two things after every perturbation:
//
//   - Geometry. Every command that tells the host how to draw the image must
//     describe the whole bitmap in the whole of the pane's cells. Anything else
//     is a scale factor, which is the stretch.
//   - Liveness. New placements must keep arriving. A stream whose placement was
//     deleted and never restored goes quiet, which is the pane that "stops
//     working" after a switch away and back.
//
// The perturbations are the ones a live session applies to a pane that is doing
// nothing itself: its neighbour prints, focus moves, the workspace is hidden and
// shown, an overlay opens over it, and it is scrolled. None of them change the
// pane's rectangle, so none of them may change what the host is told about it.

// stressRounds is how many perturbation cycles to run. The default is a short
// run for CI; DARTUIOS_KITTY_STRESS_ROUNDS raises it for a soak.

// a rectangle no bitmap it will ever send can fill, and the difference is the
