// TestSustainedOutputKeepsRendering is the regression test for the freeze.
//
// renderTerminal held the focused window's I/O read lock for its cell walk and
// then called getRealCursor, which took that same sync.RWMutex again on the same
// goroutine. Go's RWMutex is not reentrant for readers: once a writer calls
// Lock, later RLock calls block so the writer cannot be starved. The PTY reader
// takes the exclusive side for every chunk of shell output, so it regularly
// queued between the render path's two acquisitions. The UI goroutine then
// parked on its second RLock behind a writer waiting for the first RLock to be
// released, and neither could proceed. The process sat at zero CPU with a dead
// UI, within seconds of any command producing output.
//
// The assertion is deliberately about *continued* rendering rather than about a
// single frame: a frozen dartuios keeps showing whatever was on screen when it
// died, so "content is present" passes against a corpse. Each round emits a
// marker the shell computes, and the marker must appear on screen while the
// previous rounds' output is still streaming. A frozen UI never shows the next
// marker.
//
// Negative control: verified to fail against a binary with commit 6ca26b1's
// change to internal/app/render_terminal.go reverted, where it hangs on an early
// round with a stale screen. See NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md.
