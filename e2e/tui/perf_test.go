// These live beside the behavioural e2e tests because they need the same thing
// those tests need, a real binary in a real PTY with a real daemon behind it.
// A Go benchmark in the main module can time a render function; it cannot time
// the path from a keypress to the character on screen, which crosses a socket,
// a PTY, a shell and a compositor before it gets there.
//
// They are gated behind DARTUIOS_PERF on top of DARTUIOS_E2E because they are
// measurements rather than assertions: they take minutes, they report numbers
// instead of passing or failing, and a number that moved is a thing for a human
// to read rather than for CI to reject. Wall-clock thresholds in CI would be
// flaky in exactly the way that trains people to ignore a red build.

// Every number is reported as a distribution, not a mean. Startup and latency
// both have long right tails (a scheduler hiccup, a cold page fault), and a mean
// hides which of "usually fast" and "always fast" is true. The median is what a
// user feels most of the time and p90 is what they complain about.
