// The report this file exists for: "the scrolling still breaks randomly".
//
// A pane scrolled back is a place in the history, not a distance from the
// bottom. The bottom moves whenever the pane's history gets longer, and it gets
// longer on two paths a user never asked about: the guest printing a line, and
// a workspace switch priming the pane from the daemon's copy. So the trigger is
// output, and output arrives when it arrives, which is what "randomly" means
// from the chair.
//
// Both rows drive one real dartuios on one real daemon, real SGR wheel reports for
// the scroll and the real leader chord for the workspace switch. The assertion
// is the frame: the newest line on screen is where the viewport is.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching both
// rows fail:
//
//   - Window.RecordScrollAnchor returning at the top, so no scroll is ever
//     recorded as a place in the history: the first row fails saying the
//     newest line on screen went from ANCHOR-330-END to nothing at all while
//     the guest was printing, and the second says the same of the round trip.
//   - Window.ApplyScrollAnchor returning at the top, so nothing derives an
//     offset from the anchor: the same two failures with the same numbers,
//     because recording an anchor nothing reads is the shipped behaviour
//     before this fix.
//
// The clamp at each end of the derive is pinned in internal/terminal, where
// window_scroll_anchor_test.go also records which of its controls turned out
// to be invalid.
//
// The strip, which is the other thing "scrolling" means in dartuios, is pinned in
// scroll_strip_workspace_test.go. This file is only about a pane's own
// scrollback.

// anchorProducer starts a background job in the focused pane's shell that
// prints one tagged line every 50ms, and returns once the shell confirms the
// job is running.
//
// It is started before the scroll rather than after, because typing into a
// scrolled pane is itself a documented way back to live output
// (TestTypingWhileScrolledSnapsBackToLiveOutput). The delay in front of the
// loop gives the wheel gesture time to land first.

// TestAPeersWorkspaceSwitchLeavesAScrolledPaneWhereItIs is the same defect on

// this client too. Coming back primes every pane on the workspace from the
// daemon's copy of its history, and that merges rows the local emulator never
// scrolled: the history gets hundreds of lines longer in one call. Held at a
// distance from the end, the view does not creep, it jumps.
