// TestDaemonCaptureKeepsFastOutput pins the daemon emulator as the authority it
// is now declared to be.
//
// docs/REHYDRATION.md, "What is authoritative": the daemon emulator is
// authoritative for grid, cursor, modes and scrollback, and its feed blocks
// rather than dropping a chunk when it falls behind. Every route into a pane
// rehydrates from it, so anything it fails to see is content no client can be
// given.
//
// # Why this test exists rather than a unit test
//
// It was written as a standing reproduction of the opposite. The read loop used
// to offer each chunk to the emulator's feeder and drop it when the queue was
// full, on the stated grounds that the client's own emulator was what rendered.
// The first campaign run against the new PTY oracle found it in minutes: a pane
// printing 1200 lines left holes in capture-pane while a control file written by
// the same pipeline had every line. It was fixed in 445ca0e, "stop dropping
// output from the daemon's own emulator", as part of the rehydration audit.
//
// A drop is load dependent, which is what makes it a bad fit for a unit test and
// a good fit for here: it needs a real daemon, a real shell writing as fast as
// it can into a real PTY, and a reader that has to keep up. tee is the control,
// so one write reaches both a file and the terminal; a complete file puts printf,
// seq and the shell beyond suspicion and places any loss inside dartuios.
//
// The assertion is adjacency rather than a line count, because a line count
// cannot tell a slow reader from a lossy one: the numbers say where the hole is.
