// The other machine is real in every way that matters: a second daemon with
// its own runtime directory, its own sessions and its own shells, reached only
// over the hub daemon's link. The ssh stand-in below switches the XDG
// directories to that machine's before it runs the command, so `ssh build
// dartuios stdio-proxy` reaches the second daemon's socket and nothing else. No
// network is used and nothing reads the developer's ssh configuration.
//
// What would pass a weaker test and fail these: a --host flag that still runs
// ssh in a pane (the session would be drawn by a nested client and the hub's
// daemon would hold a second window), a rail row that opens a pane instead of
// switching (same), or a relay that carries the attach and not the keystrokes
// (the echo would never come back).

// rooted at remoteBase. Every XDG directory is switched before the command
