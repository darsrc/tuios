// TestSessionMadeWithoutATerminalGivesItsPanesARealTerm creates a session from
// a command with no terminal of its own, the way a script, a service, CI or an
// agent does, and reads the TERM its pane's shell was given.
//
// The command's hello to the daemon carried the TERM detected from its own
// stdout. With no terminal there, and no TERM and COLORTERM=truecolor in its
// environment to trust instead, detection answers dumb, and every pane of the
// session kept TERM=dumb for its life: clear did nothing, and less and vim ran
// without cursor movement, even after a person attached from a real terminal.
// The panes are drawn by dartuios's emulator, not by the command's stdout, and a
// session made by attaching or by the new-session verb already got the daemon's
// xterm-256color. GitHub's runners set TERM=dumb, which is how
// TestScreenshotDrawsAStraightBorderWithoutNotches found it: its clear left the
// typed command on the first row.
//
// How this could pass wrongly, written down first:
//   - The environment could hold a TERM and COLORTERM=truecolor that detection
//     trusts as they are, so the no-terminal path never runs. The command is
//     given TERM=dumb and an empty COLORTERM, which is what a runner has.
//   - A daemon started earlier with another environment could answer. The
//     test has its own base, and the first command it runs starts the daemon.
//   - The line read could be the shell's echo of the typed command. The shell
//     prints the value through a format, so only its output has a TERM= line
//     without %s in it.
//   - The line could be read while the shell's output is still arriving, cut
//     after TERM. The output ends in a marker, and only a line ending in it
//     is read.
//
// The pane's text is saved under artifactDir.
