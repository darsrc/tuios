// What a session switch does to a pane that is not black and white.
//
// The in-process matrix compares two emulators. This drives a real client in a
// real terminal and reads the pixels it actually painted, which is where the
// report came from: colours changing and cells going missing after a switch.
//
// tuitest keeps a cell's colour encoding, so a palette entry and the RGB it
// resolves to are two different values here. That distinction is the whole of
// the colour bug: a palette entry follows the user's terminal theme and the RGB
// does not, so a pane that comes back in RGB is a pane repainted in shades the
// user never chose, even though it is the same shade on the developer's own
// default theme.

// twoSessionClientIn is twoSessionClient with extra flags on the client, for
// the tests whose bug only shows under a particular border setting.
