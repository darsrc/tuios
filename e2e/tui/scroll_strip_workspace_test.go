// The report this file exists for: scroll the strip in the scrolling (niri)
// layout, switch workspace, come back, and the scroll is gone.
//
// One real dartuios on one real daemon, three named panes, the real leader chord
// for the workspace switch and real SGR wheel reports for the scroll. The
// assertion is the frame: where the columns are drawn is where the strip is.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching the
// named row fail:
//
//   - ScrollingOnFocusChange calling ScrollToFocusedColumn again, which is the
//     shipped code before the fix: TestWorkspaceRoundTripKeepsTheScrolledStrip
//     fails with ALPHA drawn back at the left edge after the round trip.
//   - EnsureFocusedVisible never revealing anything:
//     TestWorkspaceRoundTripRevealsAHiddenColumn fails with the focused column
//     still off screen. That is the positive control on the row above: a fix
//     that only stopped the strip moving would leave the user typing into a
//     pane they cannot see, and this suite would say so.
//
// One control matters most here: giving EnsureFocusedVisible the peek margin,
// so it moves an already-visible column. That fails the "kept" row too, which
// is how these tests are known to be bound to the threshold rather than to the
// name of the function called.

// stripClient brings up one client on one daemon session with three named
// panes in the scrolling layout, focused on the leftmost column.

//   - TestAParkedStripSurvivesNothingHappening passes under every mutation
//     above. It is the row that says the two above are measuring an event
//     rather than the passage of time.
//   - The reveal moved out of the retile and into GetOrCreateScrollingLayout,
//     where a strip is built for the first time. Taking it out of there
//     instead fails internal/app.TestWorkspaceSwitchLandsBothClientsOnOneStrip,
//     saying the strip is at home with the focused column off screen. That is
