# This is the component the whole feature is for. With several agents working in
# several panes, the one thing you want off the bar is whether any of them is
# waiting on you, and that is exactly the thing you cannot see because the pane
# is not on screen.
#
# It refreshes on the event rather than on a timer, so it costs nothing at all
# until an agent's state actually changes.
