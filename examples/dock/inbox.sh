#
# A push component stays running and each line it writes replaces the cell. It
# is the answer to "wake me when X changes" for anything that can tell you: you
# bring the watcher, dartuios reads the pipe. No polling, and no wake at all until
# something actually happens.
#
# The shape here is the shape of every push component: emit once so the cell is
# populated straight away, then block on a watcher and emit again on each
# change. If the process exits, dartuios restarts it with backoff, and after
# enough consecutive failures with no output it stops and waits for a
# `dartuios refresh-dock inbox`.
