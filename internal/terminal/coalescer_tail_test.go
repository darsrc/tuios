// TestPacedCoalescerStillEmitsAfterTheFloodStops guards the failure mode that
// would be worse than the one the pacing fixes.
//
// Pacing makes a flooding pane wait longer between render signals, and a rate
// limit that swallows the last signal of a burst leaves the pane showing
// whatever it had one interval ago, forever, with no further output to shake it
// loose. The coalescer's tail is what prevents that: an interval that has
// already emitted arms a timer, and that timer emits when it expires. Pacing
// only changes how long that interval is, so this asserts the guarantee holds
// at the ceiling, where the wait is longest.
