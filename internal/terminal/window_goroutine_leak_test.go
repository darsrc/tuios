// TestDaemonWindowOpenCloseLeaksNoGoroutines asserts that opening and closing a
// daemon window leaves nothing running.
//
// NewDaemonWindow starts two goroutines, outputWriter and renderCoalescer,
// and renderCoalescer owns an 8ms rate-limit timer. Both select on
// w.outputDone, and Close() is the only thing that closes it. Leaking either
// one leaks the timer, the Window, and the whole vt.Emulator with its
// scrollback, per window, for the life of the process. That has been a real bug here, and the
// failure mode (slow memory growth, a background goroutine still ticking for a
// pane the user closed) is invisible to every functional test.
//
// synctest is what makes this a real assertion rather than a heuristic. Inside
// a bubble, the test fails if any goroutine started in the bubble is still
// alive when the bubble's root function returns: no goroutine-count sampling,
// no sleeping and hoping, no parsing of runtime stack dumps. It also makes the
// timer's fake time advance only when everything is durably blocked, so a
// coalescer that survived Close would keep the bubble alive and be reported.
//
// Verified to fail on broken code: commenting out the `close(w.outputDone)` in
// Close() makes this test fail with
// "panic: deadlock: main bubble goroutine has exited but blocked goroutines
// remain", with a stack naming Window.outputWriter as the survivor.
