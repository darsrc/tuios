// The render coalescer, measured on its own.
//
// A daemon pane's output does not reach the client's event loop directly. It is
// written to the emulator by outputWriter, which raises a flag, and a separate
// goroutine turns that flag into the render signal. Everything above this in
// the stack (the socket, the PTY, the guest, the compositor) is excluded here
// on purpose: this is the one hop with a fixed interval in it, and the only way
// to know what that interval really costs is to measure it with nothing else in
// the number.
//
// The pane is left quiet before each sample. That is not a convenience: a
// keystroke is by definition something a user does to a pane they were looking
// at, so the quiet case is the one that decides how typing feels, and a
// coalescer's cost to a quiet pane is a different question from its cost to a
// pane already saturating the pipe.
