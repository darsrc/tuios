// TestDaemonWindowCloseUnderOutputFlood is a race-detector regression test for
// the window teardown races in window_io.go: Close() closing outputDone while
// outputWriter/renderCoalescer select on it, and the unlocked w.Terminal /
// w.Pty dereferences in the reader goroutines that panicked after Close nilled
// the fields. It opens a daemon window (which starts outputWriter and
// renderCoalescer), floods it with output from several goroutines, and closes
// it concurrently. Run with -race to detect torn field access; a passing run
// also proves Close is panic-free and idempotent under load. It is kept
// alongside the synctest version in window_goroutine_leak_test.go rather than
// replaced by it: this one runs with real goroutine scheduling and real
// parallelism, which is what makes the race detector useful, while the synctest
// version adds the goroutine-lifetime assertion that real scheduling cannot
// give deterministically.
