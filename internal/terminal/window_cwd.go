//
// The false answer is "nobody looked": this platform cannot read another
// process's working directory, the process is gone, it belongs to another user,
// or the pgid was never recorded. Only a true answer is evidence of anything,
// and a caller must not read the empty string as the root directory. That
// matters beyond the window title: cwdIsSpoofed rests on this, and a false
// answer leaves the sidebar's file actions live on a directory a pane named
// over OSC 7.

// answer, which is why sameDir compares by identity as well as by name.
