// The anchor rule, pinned per case. The e2e suite drives the same rule through
// a real pane and a real wheel (e2e/tui/scroll_anchor_test.go); these are the
// fast half, and they are where the clamp's own controls live because no frame
// on screen can tell one end of the clamp from the other.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching the
// named tests fail. Every one of them was run twice, once on the pure emulator
// and once under -tags ghostty, and the two agree:
//
//   - RecordScrollAnchor returning at the top, so nothing is ever anchored:
//     TestAnchorHoldsWhenHistoryIsMergedNotPrinted fails saying the history grew by 300 lines and the offset stayed at 20,
//     TestAClearedHistoryPutsThePaneBackOnLiveOutput fails with an offset of 20
//     against an empty history, and
//     TestOutputBetweenTheTwoHalvesIsNotMistakenForAScroll fails saying the
//     view drifted from line 59 to line 109.
//   - ApplyScrollAnchor returning at the top, so nothing derives an offset:
//     the same three fail. The plain case, new output under a scrolled pane,
//     is held end to end by e2e/tui/scroll_anchor_test.go.
//   - The clamp's lower end (max(..., 0)) removed:
//     TestAClearedHistoryPutsThePaneBackOnLiveOutput fails with an offset of
//     -59, which the render path would read as a row before the start of the
//     ring.
//   - RecordScrollAnchor recording on every call rather than on a changed
//     offset: TestOutputBetweenTheTwoHalvesIsNotMistakenForAScroll fails,
//     because the anchor then follows the end of the history by exactly the
//     amount this whole file exists to cancel.
//   - The clamp's upper end (min(..., sbLen)) removed: NOTHING FAILS, and the
//     control is reported as invalid rather than left looking pinned. An anchor
//     is recorded as scrollbackLen-offset from an offset every caller already
//     clamps to the length, so it is never negative and the upper end is never
//     the binding one. It is kept as defense against a future caller that does
//     not clamp.
//
//   - TestALivePaneIsNotAnchored and TestScrollingBackDownToLiveDropsTheAnchor
//     pass under every control above, which is right: they are about a pane
//     with no anchor to lose, and they are the guard on a fix that held a live
//     pane back from its own output.
//   - TestASaturatedRingKeepsTheOffsetInRange passes under every control above
//     too. It pins a limit rather than the rule, so it is not the row to read
//     for whether the anchor works.

// TestAnchorHoldsWhenHistoryIsMergedNotPrinted is the control on the shape of
// the fix, and it drives the real rehydration path rather than an imitation of
// it: session.TerminalStateOf takes the daemon's snapshot and
// session.ApplyTerminalState merges it into the client's emulator, which is
// what primePaneFromDaemon does on a workspace switch.
//
// The rows it merges never pass through the emulator's scroll path, so a count
// of the lines the emulator scrolled would miss every one of them and the view
// would jump by the whole merge. What is asserted is that the offset grew by
// exactly as much as the history did, which is the same thing said without
// naming an index: the viewport top stayed where it was while the end of the
// history moved away from it.
//
// It asserts that rather than the text of the top row, and the reason is worth
// writing down. On the ghostty backend the merge does not extend the history,
// it replaces it: the client's own oldest lines are dropped and the daemon's
// window becomes the whole of the pane's history, so the content under any
// index moves. That is a defect in ApplyTerminalState's incremental branch
// against that backend, not in the anchor, and the anchor cannot paper over it.
// Filed as issue #146 with the reproduction. Until it is fixed a pane on the
// ghostty backend still jumps on a workspace switch, for that reason and not
// this one.
//
// It also used to push lines into the ring by hand, reading each one back out
// of the emulator to get a line to push. That passed on the pure emulator and
// failed under ghostty, and the backend was right: ScrollbackLine flushes a
// pending restore and PushScrollbackLine buffers into one, so reading between
// pushes tore the restore in half and its hard reset threw the history away.
// Production never interleaves the two, and neither does this now.
