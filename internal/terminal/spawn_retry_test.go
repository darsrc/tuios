// This is the standalone half of the spawn story. A pane created without a
// daemon used to allocate its own PTY and start its own process inline, with no
// retry, so the kernel's transient controlling-terminal refusal came back as a
// nil window: a pane the user asked for that never appeared, and no error
// anywhere saying why. The daemon path had learned about the refusal months
// earlier; this path had not, because the knowledge lived in a copy.
//
// Negative control, confirmed against the tree before this change: both tests
// fail there, and they fail on the injection never being consumed. That is the
// finding stated as an assertion: NewWindow called xpty.NewPty and pty.Start
// itself, so a refusal aimed at the shared door never reached it, and no policy
// written at that door could have covered this path.

// failNextStarts makes the next n starts fail with err, then delegates to the
// real start. It returns a counter of injected failures.
