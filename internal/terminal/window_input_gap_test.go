// TestFloodedPaneLeavesRoomForInput is the regression test for keystrokes
// queueing behind a text flood.
//
// The client composes frames on the same goroutine that carries keystrokes, so
// a keypress can only be handled in a gap between frames. The coalescer used to
// signal every 8ms regardless of what a frame cost; once a frame cost more than
// that, a signal was always already waiting when the goroutine came back around
// and there was no gap left. With DOOM-fire at 158x40 a key took 18-28ms p50
// and up to 55ms to reach the pty, against 1ms through tmux.
//
// This models that goroutine rather than the whole client: one loop that
// serves either a render signal or a keystroke, where serving a render signal
// costs a fixed simulated compose. That is the contention in its smallest
// honest form, and it makes the test independent of how fast this machine
// happens to compose a real frame.
