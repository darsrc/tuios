// Package ptyspawn is the one door every PTY-backed process in dartuios goes
// through. Allocating the pty, giving the child its controlling terminal, and
// starting it are one operation here, because they have one failure mode that
// has to be handled in one place.
//
// That failure mode is a transient EPERM from the kernel's controlling-terminal
// grab (ioctl TIOCSCTTY in the forked child). Captured under strace on Linux
// 7.2, the child is a clean session leader (setsid succeeded) holding the
// freshly opened slave at fd 0, no LSM is filtering, and the identical grab on a
// fresh pty succeeds milliseconds later. Every capture involved the just-freed
// lowest pts index while other shells were being SIGKILLed, so this is the pts
// index being recycled out from under a session that is still being torn down.
//
// It is treated the way EINTR is treated: retried, bounded, and never quietly.
// The retry allocates a new pty rather than reusing the refused one, because the
// refusal is about that index. A persistent EPERM still surfaces at the bound,
// and no other error is ever retried.
//
// The daemon path and the standalone path both call Spawn, so both get the
// same retry. A separate copy per path can miss the refusal, and the result is
// a pane whose shell never starts.
