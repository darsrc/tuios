// These tests pin the retry policy at the one door every PTY-backed process in
// dartuios goes through. The real event cannot be provoked on demand (it needs a
// pts index to be recycled out from under a dying session at the exact moment
// of the fork), so the seam injects the refusal the way the kernel delivers it:
// as an EPERM-wrapped start error.
//
// Negative control for all four: with the retry removed from Spawn, the
// transient case fails (one refusal becomes a returned error) and the
// fresh-PTY case fails (there is no second attempt to compare). The two that
// assert a refusal still surfaces pass either way and are there to keep the
// bound honest, not to detect its absence.
