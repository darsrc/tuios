// Config is the configuration the tour runs with: the shipped defaults, with
// the looks the lessons were written against pinned in place.
//
// v0.8.0 changed seven defaults: the rail came on, on the right and narrower,
// the dock and the window titles moved to the top, a zoomed pane stopped
// short of the whole screen, a click on a pane began to need a second one to
// start typing, and the scrollbar drew a track. The lessons, their
// screenshots and the steps that point at the dock or ask for a click all
// describe the screen as it was before, so the tour keeps that screen. Each
// value is written out rather than left unset, so a later change to a default
// cannot move the tour without a change here.
