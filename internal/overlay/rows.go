// The focus and hover rule every list in dartuios follows: the rail, the Inbox,
// the review overlay, settings, the command palette and every picker.
//
//  1. Reserve the cell. Whatever a row shows when it is the cursor (a mark, a
//     bold name) has a cell kept for it on every other row, so nothing moves
//     when the cursor does.
//  2. Change only colour. The cursor, the pointer and focus are grounds and
//     inks, never extra or fewer cells.
//  3. Always show the cursor. A list that does not have the keyboard still
//     shows where its cursor is, on the quieter RowSelQuiet, so the user knows
//     where they will land and which list is listening.
//
// At 16 colours the grounds are the terminal's own, so the states are
// attributes instead: the focused cursor is reverse video, and an unfocused
// cursor and the pointer underline the row's text.

// RowState is what a list row is at this moment.

// rows sit on base. The cursor always wins over the pointer: a row carrying
// both would read as a third state that means nothing.
