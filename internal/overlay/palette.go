// Package overlay provides composable, framework-agnostic building blocks for
// borderless floating overlay panels rendered with charm.land/lipgloss/v2.
//
// The design is deliberately borderless: a panel is a solid Surface-filled
// rectangle whose neutrals step by luminance (Canvas < Panel < Surface < Card)
// so it reads as a raised, floating surface without box-drawing characters.
// Selection is shown with a full-width highlight bar rather than an arrow, and
// an inset accent title chip identifies the panel. At 16 colours, where a
// surface cannot be told from the terminal's own background, a panel draws a
// hairline frame instead and a selected row is reverse video (see Depth).
//
// Every renderer returns both the rendered string and a Geometry describing the
// panel-relative rectangles of its interactive regions (title bar, tabs, body
// origin), so a host can hit-test mouse events without duplicating layout math.
//
// This package is also where dartuios keeps its colour tokens: the Palette, the
// rules that derive and contrast-check it (Derive), the per-depth rules
// (depth.go), the perceptual blend (oklab.go) and the one focus and hover rule
// every list follows (rows.go). Render code takes its colours from here and
// from the theme package, never from a literal; a lint holds it to that.
//
// The package holds no dartuios state and depends only on lipgloss, the charm x
// packages and the standard library, so it can be lifted out into a standalone
// module.

// Palette is the semantic color set a panel is rendered with. Callers provide
// it, keeping this package independent of any particular theming system.
//
// The neutral ramp (Canvas, Panel, Surface, RowSel, Card) should step by
// luminance so surfaces read as layered without borders. Accent carries "this
// is the interactive thing"; Warn is reserved for destructive actions.
//
// The fields after Warning are derived: Derive fills them from the ones above,
// so a palette built by hand sets the base tokens and calls Derive once.
