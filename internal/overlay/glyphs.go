// It is pushed rather than pulled for the same reason SetASCII is: this package
// depends on nothing inside dartuios so that it can be lifted out, and the registry
// that resolves a named set lives above it. An empty field means "keep the
// built-in", so a set that renames two glyphs is two fields rather than a full
// table.

	Rule       string // a panel's solid divider

// font can draw, and --ascii-only says the running terminal cannot draw it,
// which is the narrower claim and the one to believe. The test is per glyph
// rather than per set, so a set that is ASCII in the roles it can be keeps them
// in a terminal that has to be.
