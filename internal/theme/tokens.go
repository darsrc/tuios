// chrome palette (UI) because they stand for something outside it: the macOS
// window controls, the link under the pointer, the key-cast pills. They were
// literals in the render code; they live here so every colour a frame can
// hold is defined in the token packages, and each answers for the 16-colour
// depth with a slot the terminal paints from its own palette.
