// alone would enter the code below the wiring and say nothing about whether a
// pointer can reach it, which is how a feature ships that passes every test it
// has and cannot be triggered.
//
// The three that matter are the ones named after what they protect: a divider
// drag, a window drag and a sweep across the screen. Each is a real pointer
// gesture a person makes while working, played back through the same path a
// terminal's events take.

// off, and the real input handler in place.
