// h and l are snap_left and snap_right in window-management mode. With tiling
// off they snap the focused window to a half of the screen. With tiling on
// they used to do nothing at all, silently, and tiling is the default: the two
// most reachable letters on the home row were dead keys for most users.
//
// Under tiling they move focus to the neighbour in that direction, which
// completes the row the other two vim pairs already have: H and L swap that
// way, alt+h and alt+l preselect there.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching the
// named row fail:
//
//   - snapOrFocus returning before SnapByDirection with tiling on, which is
//     the handler before this change: both tiled rows of
//     TestSnapKeysFocusANeighbourUnderTiling fail saying focus stayed on the
//     pane it started on.
//   - SnapByDirection erroring under tiling for every direction, which is the
//     executor before this change: the same two rows fail the same way, and
//     TestRunCommandSnapLeftFocusesUnderTiling fails on the error.
//
// One control turned out invalid and is recorded rather than claimed:
// focusTiledNeighbour asking the geometry in the scrolling layout fails
// nothing here, because FocusWindow already brings the strip's focused column
// along with it. The scrolling row pins that the strip follows, not which
// road got it there.

// sideBySide is two windows across a 100x30 screen, the left one focused.
