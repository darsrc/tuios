// Layout independence.
//
// A key reaches dartuios as the character the active layout produced, so with a
// Ukrainian layout the I key arrives as "ш" and nothing is bound to that. The
// Kitty keyboard protocol's alternate-key reporting also names the key at the
// same position on a US layout (the base-layout key), which Bubble Tea puts in
// Key.BaseCode. The helpers here fall back to that key when the produced one
// means nothing, so every binding answers to the physical key under any layout.
//
// The produced key always wins when it matches: a user who bound "ш" gets that
// binding. And nothing here applies to text being typed (a rename, a search, a
// palette query, a pane): those take msg.Text, which is still the character the
// user typed.

// baseLayoutKey returns the binding spelling of the US-layout key at the
// position of msg, and whether msg carries one that differs from the key it
// produced. A shifted letter is spelled as the capital letter, the way
// bindings write it; any other chord is spelled with its modifiers.

// quit, split a pane, jumped to window 2, and took an editor's C-x for the
