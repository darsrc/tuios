// Constructing an app.OS loads (and, when absent, writes) the user config, and
// several overlays read and write tape and layout files. See
// testutil.RunIsolated for why this cannot be a per-test helper.
//
// It also seeds config.Global with the looks from before v0.8.0, which the
// fixtures here were measured against: a click that starts typing, the dock
// at the bottom, no rail. internal/app's TestMain says the same.
