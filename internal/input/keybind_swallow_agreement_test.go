// The keybind report tells users which keys never reach the program in their
// pane, and it works that out from its own copy of two predicates the input
// path owns, because config cannot import input. A report that disagrees with
// the router is worse than no report: it is a confident wrong answer about
// whether the user's editor is going to keep working.
//
// So the agreement is checked against what the router actually does with the
// key rather than against the predicates directly. handleTerminalModeBinds is
// the function terminal mode consults before forwarding anything, and its
// return value is exactly "this key does not reach the pane".
