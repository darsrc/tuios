//     on "!" matches whether the terminal sent the character or the chord.
//   - Key.Keystroke() is the chord spelling. It prefers the PC-101 base code
//     that the Kitty protocol's alternate-key reporting supplies, which is what
//     turns a composed or non-US-layout key back into the key the user pressed.
