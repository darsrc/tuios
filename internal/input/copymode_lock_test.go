// Note on what is NOT tested here, deliberately.
//
// The copy-mode side effects run outside the RLockIO region. No runtime test
// can tell that apart from running them inside it: asserting the lock is free
// after HandleCopyModeKey returns passes either way, because a deferred
// window.RUnlockIO() also releases before returning. The hazard is latent
// (nothing called inside that region blocks or re-locks), so there is no
// observable behaviour to assert on.
//
// The guarantee is structural, and the compiler enforces it:
// handleNormalInput, handleSearchInput and handleVisualInput do not receive a
// *app.OS at all. Code running under the lock has no route to the
// OS, and therefore no route to a PTY write or a second RLockIO. Reintroducing
// the hazard requires changing those signatures, which is a visible edit
// rather than an accidental one.
//
// The tests below cover what IS observable: that the traversal is still
// correctly synchronized against the PTY writer, and that moving the effects
// did not change what they do.

// TestCopyModeKeyAgainstConcurrentPTYWriter drives the interleaving the
// narrowing is about: a copy-mode key handler walking the cell buffer while
// the PTY writer mutates it under the exclusive lock.
//
// Run with -race. It covers two things at once: that the traversal is properly
// synchronized against the writer (a missing lock shows up as a data race on
// the emulator cell buffer), and that neither side starves (a handler that
// took the lock reentrantly, or held it across a blocking effect, wedges here
// and the test never finishes).

	// buffer under LockIO on its own goroutine. This is WriteOutputAsync, not
	// WriteOutput; the async path is the only one production uses, and unlike
	// the sync one it leaves the UI-goroutine-owned dirty flags alone.
	//
	// Volume is deliberately small and bounded. Copy-mode motions are
	// O(scrollback) per keypress and WriteOutputAsync applies no backpressure,
	// so an unbounded flood makes this quadratic and turns a lock test into a
	// multi-minute benchmark. What matters is that the two lock users
	// interleave, not how much data moves.
