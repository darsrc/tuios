// A drag is a gesture, and the sizes it passes through on the way are not sizes
// the guest was ever meant to live at. A borderless pane gives its shared-border
// allowance up on the first motion so it can draw its own frame, and the retile
// on the drop gives it back. In a tiled layout the pane usually lands in a slot
// the same size as the one it left, so both of those were avoidable, and each of
// them reaches the shell as a SIGWINCH it answers by repainting its prompt.
//
// These count the sizes the guest was handed, not the size it ends up with. The
// drop puts the size back, so a check made after the gesture reads the right
// number for the wrong reason.
//
// They drive OS.Update rather than the handlers directly, because the hold is
// armed by the press in Update: a test that called handleMouseClick would enter
// the code below the arming and prove nothing about whether anything arms it.

// countSizes records every size a pane is handed from now on. The layout is
// announced once first, which is the state a session is in before a gesture.
