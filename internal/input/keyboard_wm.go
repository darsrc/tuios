// remoteKeyBypassesCopyMode reports whether the key being handled came from a
// remote sender (dartuios send-keys, or a tape run from outside) rather than
// from the person at this client.
//
// Copy mode, implicit or explicit, is that person's viewport: a scrolled view
// they are reading, or a selection they are making. Their own keystroke ends
// an implicit session because they have stopped reading, and drives an
// explicit one because they asked for it. A remote key is neither. It goes
// where it would go with no copy mode in progress (to the guest, or to the
// binding it names), and the viewport stays where the person put it.
// Otherwise an agent typing into the pane while the person reads its earlier
// output would return the view to the bottom at a moment decided by another
// process.
//
// The flag is set for the whole run of a remote key sequence or tape and
// cleared when it is done, on the Update goroutine that dispatches both.
