// sectionAction resolves a key press against one registry section, trying every
// spelling the terminal might have sent it as.
//
// This is what replaced the hand-rolled isCtrlP and isLauncherKey matchers, and
// it has to keep the property they existed for. One physical chord reaches dartuios
// under several names depending on what the host negotiated: Ctrl+P stringifies
// to "ctrl+p" under the legacy control byte and CSI-u, to "p" under Kitty
// associated-text reporting, and to "ctrl+P" under alternate-key reporting.
// bindingKeys offers String() and Keystroke() in turn, which covers the first
// three, and lookupKey lowercases compound keys, which covers the fourth. The
// lock modifiers never appear in either spelling, so Num Lock (on by default on
// most keyboards) no longer hides the binding the way an exact Mod comparison
// did. TestGlobalBindsAcrossEncodings pins all of it.

// handleGlobalBinds runs the global-scope binds, the ones that act in window
// mode and terminal mode alike, and reports whether the key was consumed.
//
// The palette and the launcher used to be literals in both mode handlers. As
// literals they were invisible to `dartuios keybinds doctor`, unrebindable, and
// silently ahead of anything a user had put on the same key.
//
// They then became two cases of a switch here, which fixed that and left a
// smaller version of the same fault: the section is documented as general, and
// anything a user put in it other than those two did nothing and said nothing.
// It goes through the dispatcher now, so the section holds whatever the
// dispatcher knows, and the two actions are registered like every other.
