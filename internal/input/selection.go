// forwardPasteToFocused sends paste text to the focused window's PTY, wrapping it in
// bracketed-paste markers when the inner app has that mode enabled and sending it raw
// otherwise. It never touches o.ClipboardContent and never shows a notification.
//
// With a multifocus set, the paste also goes to every window in the set, the way
// typed keys do (see HandleTerminalModeKey). Each window gets the markers only
// when its own app has bracketed paste on: a shell with it on and a program with
// it off must each see the paste the way they asked for it.
//
// It is used both by dartuios's own clipboard paste (which layers notifications on top)
// and by the incoming-terminal-paste path, where a tea.PasteMsg is passthrough input
// (for example an fcitx5 IME commit) and must be delivered silently.
//
// SendInput() is used rather than writing to the emulator's internal pipe,
// which in daemon mode is drained by StartDaemonResponseReader() so the data
// would never reach the PTY; SendInput() routes through DaemonWriteFunc.
// Returns false when there is no focused window, the focused window is in copy
// mode, or the write to it fails. A failed write to another window in the set is
// not reported, as with keys.
