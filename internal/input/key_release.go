// forwardKeyReleaseToFocused passes a key release on to the focused pane when
// that pane asked for releases, and reports whether it did.
//
// Only a pane that pushed the kitty keyboard protocol's event-type flag gets
// them, so nothing changes for the shells and editors that never ask. The ones
// that do ask cannot work without them: a compositor in a pane turns each report
// into a wl_keyboard event, and a press with no matching release leaves the key
// held down, which is how one Enter became a screenful of them.
//
// The gate is terminal mode, the same one bracketed paste passes through, so a
// release struck while an overlay or window management has the keyboard is
// dropped rather than delivered to a pane that never saw the press.
//
// A release goes only to the pane its press went to. The press of a key dartuios
// kept (the leader, a prefix command, a key an overlay took) never reached the
// pane, so neither does its release. A modifier key's release also needs a pane
// that asked for every key, the only mode in which a modifier is a key at all.
