package input

// Local input latency: the keystroke dartuios answers by itself.
//
// This is the floor of the whole audit. A key that switches pane never leaves
// the process: no socket, no PTY, no guest, no coalescer. Whatever it costs is
// what dartuios adds to a keystroke before any of the distributed machinery is
// involved, and the gap between this and the echo number in internal/app is
// what the daemon and the guest are worth.
//
// It lives here rather than beside the other latency measurements because the
// real key routing lives here, and internal/app cannot import it: input imports
// app, so the handler reaches app only through SetInputHandler, and a test in
// package app finds no handler registered at all.
//
// INCLUDES: HandleKeyPress routing, the action it dispatches, the per-key
// SyncStateToDaemon that internal/input does on daemon sessions, and a full
// composeFrame.
// EXCLUDES: the host terminal, bubbletea's stdin decode, and the diff written
// back to the tty.
//
