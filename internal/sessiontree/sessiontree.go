// Package sessiontree is the shared data model behind every session-management
// surface: the sidebar, the picker, and the command-palette session/window
// entries. It is pure data and queries with no rendering and no bubbletea or
// app imports, so it is unit-testable and can be built from either the client's
// live session state or the daemon's projection of another session.
//
// The three surfaces read one Tree so they can never disagree about what
// sessions and windows exist, which is current, or what agent state a session
// rolls up to. Glyphs are still chosen by the app's agentStateIndicator; this
// package only decides the rolled-up state string, in one place.
