// Package sound plays the two short cues an agent alert can make audible.
//
// It shells out to an audio player the system already has rather than linking a
// decoder and a device backend into dartuios. A multiplexer that fails to start
// because a machine has no sound card would be a poor trade for a 300 ms chime,
// and every platform dartuios runs on ships something that plays a WAV: paplay or
// pw-play under PipeWire and PulseAudio, aplay under bare ALSA, afplay on
// macOS, and the Media Foundation player Windows carries.
//
// Three properties matter more than the sound itself.
//
// Nothing here blocks its caller. Play is a bounds check, an atomic compare and
// a non-blocking channel send; every process spawn happens on one background
// goroutine. It is called from the bubbletea Update goroutine, which owns the
// frame budget, and a caller that has to wait for an audio device is a caller
// that has already lost.
//
// A machine with no audio goes quiet permanently rather than repeatedly. The
// player list is resolved once, and a run of plays that all fail switches the
// subsystem off for the life of the process, so an SSH session or a container
// pays for one failed probe rather than one per alert. Nothing is printed: a
// user who cannot hear the cue has not asked to be told about it in the middle
// of their terminal.
//
// One cue plays at a time and no faster than the cooldown. A single worker and
// a one-deep queue mean a workspace where six agents finish together makes one
// sound, not six overlapping ones.
