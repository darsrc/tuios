// The server had none. wish builds on charm.land/ssh, which sets
// NoClientAuth when no PasswordHandler, PublicKeyHandler or
// KeyboardInteractiveHandler is installed (see server.go in that module), so
// every connection was accepted, including one that names a user nobody has.
// The session it got is the full dartuios, and dartuios opens shells as the account
// running the server. That is a shell on this machine for anyone who can reach
// the port.
//
// Public keys, not passwords: every machine with an ssh client already has a
// keypair, so there is nothing new to store here and nothing to guess.

// config home. It is read before ~/.ssh/authorized_keys so a user can grant
// dartuios a narrower set than their sshd trusts.
