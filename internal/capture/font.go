// Finding the font a capture should be drawn in.
//
// The PNG backend rasterizes with a real font file, and its built-in fallback
// is Go Mono, which has no icons. Every private-use glyph in a modern prompt
// therefore came out as a tofu box unless the user found and set
// screenshot.font_file by hand. Nobody should have to: the terminal already
// knows which font it is drawing, and kitty will say so when asked.
//
// Turning that name into a path is what this file does, and it asks twice. The
// font index in fontindex.go reads the names out of the font files themselves,
// which works on every platform and needs nothing installed; fontconfig is
// asked second, for the fonts a machine keeps somewhere only fontconfig was
// told about. It cannot be asked first or only: fc-match is fontconfig's
// command line and macOS does not ship fontconfig, so no capture on macOS
// would find a font at all.
//
// The one trap in the fontconfig half is that fc-match never fails. Asked for a
// font that does not exist it substitutes its best guess and reports success,
// so an unverified lookup silently draws the capture in Noto Sans. Every
// lookup here checks that the name fontconfig echoes back is the name that was
// asked for. The index cannot substitute: it only ever answers with a file
// that says it is the font that was asked for.

// FontFace is one resolved face: the file to rasterize with, and the name that
// found it.

	// Index is the face to take from File when the file is a collection. Zero
	// is the first face, and the whole answer for a plain single font.
	Index int

// capture drawn in the fallback face beats a capture that never arrives.
