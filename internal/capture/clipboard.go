// Native image clipboard.
//
// OSC 52 is text only, so an image can never ride the escape stream. Putting a
// PNG on a clipboard therefore means running a helper on the machine that owns
// the clipboard, and the rule learned from the PR #133 review is that only a
// process actually sitting on the user's machine may do it. The CLI qualifies:
// it reaches the daemon over a unix socket, so the two are the same machine.
// An SSH client attached to a dartuios ssh server does not, and never calls this.
//
// Detection is gated on the display environment and cached, the helper is
// given a bounded deadline, and a failure degrades to the file path plus a
// notice. It is never an error state: the file is already written and the
// capture already succeeded.

// ClipboardRoute is what a copy would do on this machine.
