// A glyph set is the shape half of a rice and it has list-themes's problem: its
// value is a name from an open set that grows whenever the user writes a file,
// standing for a document kept in another format in another directory. Published
// as a bare string option it would be undiscoverable and unverifiable at once,
// so it gets the verb the palette got, answering the same three questions.
//
// The third of them is the one that matters most here and has no equivalent for
// a theme. A set says only what it changes, so "what will this look like" cannot
// be read off the file; and a role whose glyph was the wrong width is dropped
// silently on screen. Both are answered by reporting what is actually drawn
// rather than what the set asked for.
