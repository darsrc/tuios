// Pane grants: what a process in a pane may do through dartuios.
//
// Every connection on the daemon socket used to be able to call every verb.
// restrict-connection (conn_scope.go) lets a caller give authority up on its
// own connection, which bounds dartuios mcp but not a process that opens a
// connection of its own. Pane grants bound the pane: every JSON verb and
// every binary message from a connection placed in a pane of this daemon is
// checked against what that pane holds, before its handler runs.
//
// The grants:
//
//   - read: read the pane's own session and the sessions of its fan group
//     (sessionInScope): listings, captures, agent state, waits, the event
//     stream, mail and stash reads.
//   - write: type into the panes of its own session and leave mail and
//     stashed files there. A pane types only into panes that hold nothing it
//     does not, since what it types runs with the target's grants, and not
//     into a pane waiting on a prompt unless it holds respond
//     (holdTypingTarget).
//   - fan: what write does, in the sessions of its fan group and the ones it
//     launched, and start agents with fan and start-agent.
//   - respond: answer an on-screen prompt with respond, without the person's
//     attach nonce, on a pane in its reach, and type into a pane waiting on a
//     prompt. Nothing gives it by default, and admin does not imply it.
//   - admin: everything else a pane could do before grants existed, which is
//     every verb on every session, the listings across sessions, and the
//     binary protocol (attach, input). It implies read, write and fan.
//
// Every pane may also report its own state, meta and conversation id, ask
// the person as itself, hold its own approval prompt, and call the verbs that
// touch no session (hello, list-verbs, pane-grants), whatever it holds.
//
// Where a pane's grants come from:
//
//   - The grants it was started with: start-agent, fan and new-window take a
//     grants parameter, and set-pane-grants changes them later.
//   - Otherwise the default of [agents.permissions]: admin under mode open,
//     which is the default mode and exactly what every pane could do before,
//     and the grants list under mode strict.
//
// A pane can never hand out more than it holds. A pane without admin that
// starts an agent without naming grants gives the new pane its own; one that
// names grants must hold them all. Only the person, from outside every pane,
// can give respond to a pane that does not hold it.
//
// How a connection is placed in a pane: the kernel's record of the peer's pid
// first (peerPane, the test resolve-pane uses), then the DARTUIOS_PANE_ID in that
// process's environment for a pane still being created, and on a platform
// with no peer pid the DARTUIOS_PANE_ID and DARTUIOS_PANE_TOKEN the connection
// presents with pane-grants, which the dartuios CLI does on its own there. A
// connection placed in no pane is held to nothing new: the person's CLI, the
// attached client, and the hooks and dock components the person configured
// keep full rights. A connection over a link is held to that link's policy
// instead (link_policy.go), and a report from a pane this machine runs for
// another machine is held there. A process in such a pane that calls this
// daemon directly holds this machine's default and reaches no session here.
//
// This scopes accidents and prompt-injected agents, not a determined local
// attacker. A process that leaves its pane on purpose (a double fork with a
// cleaned environment, a service manager) is not placed in it by any of these
// tests, and is then treated as the person, as human_origin.go explains for
// the same checks.
