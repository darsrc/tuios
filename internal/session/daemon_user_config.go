// owns onto the daemon's own config: the [daemon] section, the [hosts] table
// and the hooks the daemon fires.
//
// Every starter calls it: `dartuios daemon`, and the SSH and web servers when
// they start a daemon in-process. It used to be three hand-written subsets,
// and a daemon started by `dartuios ssh` ran with no agent detection settings and
// no hosts while the same file gave both to a daemon started by `dartuios
// attach`. The fields the starter owns (Version, Foreground, LogFile,
// DisableAutoRestore) stay the starter's to fill.
//
// The log level is applied here as well, when nothing set it first: a flag or
// the environment wins over the file. It is a process global, so it is set
// once whoever starts the daemon.
//
// TestEveryDaemonKeyReachesTheDaemon holds this to every key in the section.
