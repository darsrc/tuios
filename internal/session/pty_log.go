// The raw output log: every byte a pane's process wrote, as it was written.
//
// It exists because a rendering fault that only shows up in a live session
// cannot be reasoned about from a screenshot or from a capture taken
// afterwards. A capture shows the grid as it is now, which says nothing about
// the moment it went wrong, and the grid is downstream of the bytes anyway.
// With the bytes, the emulator can be fed exactly what it was fed and the
// frame where it diverges can be found.
//
// It is off unless DARTUIOS_PTY_LOG names a directory, and it writes one file per
// pane. Nothing is filtered or decoded on the way in: the point is to have the
// stream as the program wrote it, escape sequences and all.
//
// It is deliberately not part of tape recording. A tape is a script of what a
// person did, meant to be replayed as input; this is the other direction and
// is meant for one purpose, which is to be replayed into an emulator.
