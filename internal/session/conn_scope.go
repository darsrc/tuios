// Restricted connections: the minimal form of scoped callers.
//
// Every connection on the daemon socket can call every verb. That is right for
// the person's own CLI and wrong for an agent that a file it read or a page it
// fetched has talked into acting on other panes. restrict-connection lets a
// client give up authority on its own connection, and the daemon then holds
// the connection to what is left for as long as it is open. A second call can
// narrow further and never widen.
//
// Two restrictions exist:
//
//   - scope own. The connection reaches only its own session: the session of
//     the pane the caller runs in, the sessions that share its fan group (the
//     siblings a fan started together), and the sessions a fan run from it
//     started. Every other session is invisible to it: reads fail with
//     forbidden, and its event stream carries nothing from them. The pane is
//     found by the kernel's record of the caller's pid first, and only when
//     that places the caller in no pane by DARTUIOS_PANE_ID plus the
//     DARTUIOS_PANE_TOKEN only that pane was started with (pane_token.go). A
//     caller placed in no pane reaches no session at all: the restriction
//     fails closed.
//   - read_only. The connection may read, report its own pane's state and
//     meta, and leave mail, and may not type into any pane: send-text,
//     send-keys, ask-agent, respond and fan are refused.
//
// Verbs outside the table below are refused on any restricted connection. The
// table has to name every verb, which a test checks, so a new verb is refused
// here until someone decides what a restricted caller may do with it.
//
// dartuios mcp restricts every connection it opens before its first call, so an
// agent that drives dartuios through MCP holds exactly what the server was
// started with. This does not stop a process in a pane from opening its own
// unrestricted connection with the dartuios CLI; it bounds the MCP surface, which
// is the one an agent reaches without writing a shell command. docs/protocol.md
// has the whole contract.
