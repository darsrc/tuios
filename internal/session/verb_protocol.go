// This file implements the typed, line-delimited JSON verb protocol layered
// additively on the existing daemon socket. One request per line:
//
//	{"id": 1, "verb": "list-windows", "params": {"session": "work"}}
//
// and one response per line, either
//
//	{"id": 1, "result": {"type": "window_list", ...}}
//
// or
//
//	{"id": 1, "error": {"code": "session_not_found", "message": "..."}}
//
// The envelope id is opaque and echoed back verbatim. Error codes are stable
// strings so a caller never has to cross-reference a numeric table. The binary
// gob/PTY fast path is untouched; a connection is detected as JSON or binary
// from its first byte on accept (see detectJSONClient).

// VerbProtocolVersion is the version of the JSON verb protocol. It is reported
// by the list-verbs introspection verb so a client can gate on it. Bump it only
// on an incompatible change to the envelope or to an existing verb's contract;
// adding a new verb is backward compatible and does not require a bump.
