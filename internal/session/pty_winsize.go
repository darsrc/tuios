// Resizes of the real PTY are coalesced. Every write of a new window size is a
// SIGWINCH for the guest, and a pane gets bursts of them: each attached client
// announces the layout it drew, so a new pane is resized several times in its
// first milliseconds, and a border drag resizes it on every mouse motion.
//
// Most guests only repaint more often than they need to. macOS /bin/bash (bash
// 3.2) dies: its SIGWINCH handler calls malloc, and a signal that lands while
// the shell is already inside malloc, which it is while readline sets LINES and
// COLUMNS at startup, deadlocks it on its own allocator lock. libplatform
// aborts it and the kernel kills it a few milliseconds after the pane opened.
//
// The rule is leading edge and trailing edge. A size change after a quiet
// period reaches the kernel at once, so the first correct size is never
// delayed. A change inside the quiet period is held, later ones replace it,
// and the last is written when the period ends. The pane's recorded size, its
// emulator and every subscriber still change at once (see PTY.Resize); only the
// guest hears about a burst later, and only once.

	// first is held until the shell has had time to reach its prompt.
