// The daemon follows the config file, so adding a machine does not mean
// restarting the daemon that holds every running session. A save that adds a
// host opens a link, a save that removes one closes it, and a save that changes
// an address dials the new one. Nothing else in the file is looked at here, and no other part of the
// daemon's configuration changes under it.
//
// The watcher is only started when a config path is set, which
// DaemonConfigFromUser fills for every real starter. A daemon built from a
// hand-made DaemonConfig, which is every test, follows no file.
//
// A file that does not parse changes nothing. The links that are up stay up,
// and the reason is logged, for the same reason the client keeps its running
// settings: a half-written file caught between an editor's two writes must not
// tear down a working link.
