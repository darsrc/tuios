// DARTUIOS_SOCKET is set in every pane to the socket of the daemon that runs it.
// It reports; it does not select. The daemon a command reaches is chosen by
// XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (LOCALAPPDATA on Windows), as GetSocketPath says.
//
// It cannot become the selector. Every process started from a pane inherits
// it, so a script run from a pane that isolates itself with its own
// XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, which is how the test suites and the demo recorder keep
// away from the person's daemon, would be sent straight back to that daemon.
//
// What it can do is stop the mistake the name invites. Someone who sets it to
// a path where no daemon listens wants a daemon of their own there, and would
// otherwise get the one XDG_RUNTIME_DIR names, which is usually the person's:
// an agent created a session in the person's daemon exactly that way. So when
// it names a socket other than the one a command would reach, and nothing
// listens on it, the command refuses and says what to set instead. When it
// names the same socket, or another live daemon's (the isolated script above),
// nothing changes.

// SocketEnv is the variable a pane is given its daemon's socket in.
