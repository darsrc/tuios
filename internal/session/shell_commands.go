// A shell's commands, followed through its OSC 133 marks.
//
// A shell with prompt integration (zsh, fish and bash with a setup, and
// every shell a terminal like Ghostty, kitty or WezTerm injects its script
// into) brackets each command with four marks: A where the prompt starts, B
// where the input starts, C when the command runs and D;<status> when it
// finishes. The daemon's emulator already records them for the scrollback
// browser. This file turns them into facts about the pane:
//
//   - whether the shell is at a prompt, which is what run checks before it
//     types, so a command is never typed into a program that is running;
//   - the command running now, or the last one, with its exit status and
//     how long it took;
//   - command_seq, how many commands the pane has finished, which makes a
//     wait for "the next one" free of races;
//
// and into the prompt, command-started and command-finished events, which
// wait-for, run and the after-command-finished hook consume.
//
// Nothing here guesses. A pane whose shell never sent a mark has no shell
// facts at all, and the verbs that need them say so with no_shell_integration
// rather than inventing an answer from the screen.
//
// A shell can also mark its prompts and never its commands: bash before 4.4
// ignores the PS0 the bash recipe sends C from, and some prompt themes send A
// alone. Its pane looks like one at a prompt even while a command runs. Before
// any command that cannot be told from a shell that has not run one yet, so
// run types its first line there. The tracker then watches for the C: when the
// shell instead draws a new prompt on a later row, the pane is prompt-only,
// at_prompt is false from then on, and run refuses it.

// shellCmdlineMax bounds a command line as the daemon reports it, in bytes.
// It goes to every subscriber and every hook, so it is cut, and likely secrets
// in it are masked, the way an Inbox summary is.
