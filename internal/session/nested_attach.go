// Attaching a session from one of its own panes.
//
// A client's size is its terminal's size, and the session's size is the
// smallest size of its clients. A client that runs in a pane of the session it
// shows has a terminal that is that pane, so its size is the session's size
// less the chrome around the pane. Each resize the client reports shrinks the
// session, which shrinks the pane, which shrinks the client: the session ends
// at 1x1 and the outer client draws one cell (#235). Its output also lands in
// the pane it draws, so it redraws its own frames without end. It is a
// mistake nobody means to make, since the person is already looking at that
// session.
//
// So the daemon places every attaching client, and refuses it when it would
// show a session inside itself. A client is placed in the session of a pane
// by the first of these that applies:
//
//   - its controlling terminal is the pane's;
//   - it has a terminal of its own: its nesting probe showed up in the pane's
//     output (nest_probe.go). That is what makes the loop, so it is the whole
//     answer. It catches script, ssh to this machine and other relays that
//     pass bytes, and lets through a terminal window started from a pane,
//     whose ancestry and variables point into the pane but whose output does
//     not;
//   - it has no terminal, so no probe: a pane's shell is one of its
//     ancestors, or its environment names a pane of this daemon.
//
// It is refused when it is placed in the session it asks for, or in a session
// that is itself shown, through a chain of clients, inside the one it asks
// for: session A in a pane of B, and B in a pane of A, is the same loop.
//
// An attach to any other session goes through. A pane of one session showing
// another is the ordinary tmux-like use.
//
// dartuios attach --force, or AllowNestedEnv, skips the check, for the person who
// means it. A served client (dartuios-web, the SSH server) is not placed by its
// process, because the process is the server: its size comes from the remote
// viewer. It is placed by its probe, which the SSH server writes to the ssh
// channel. Nothing here can see a relay that redraws the screen instead of
// passing bytes (tmux, mosh). The size floor keeps such a loop at 20x6. See
// minClientWidth.
