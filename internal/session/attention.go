// The Inbox: one daemon-owned queue of everything waiting for the person.
//
// Attention used to be spread over the rail's counts, title glyphs, the dock
// (for the attached session only), the newest-message jump and the mail
// overlay, and a pane in a session nobody was attached to raised nothing at
// all. The daemon already sees every transition in every session, so it keeps
// the one list here and every surface reads it: list-attention answers it, and
// every change to it is an attention event on the resumable stream.
//
// An item is derived from facts the daemon already owns, and it closes when the
// fact that opened it stops being true:
//
//   - approval and question: a pane on needs_input, split by blocked_by. It
//     closes when the pane leaves needs_input.
//   - errored: a pane on errored. It closes when the pane leaves errored.
//   - finished: a pane's completion_seq went up while it came to rest. It
//     closes when an attached client focuses the pane (the same rule as
//     finished_unread), when the agent starts another turn, or on dismiss.
//   - mail: a message to human in one thread. It closes when the ring says the
//     person's mail in that thread is read.
//   - resume: a pane a restore brought back with an agent conversation that
//     can be resumed (agent_resume.go). It closes when the conversation is
//     resumed, when an agent starts working in the pane, or on dismiss.
//
// Every item is keyed by what it is about (session, window and class, or
// session and thread for mail), so a pane flapping, a harness repeating itself
// or sixteen agents in a fan finishing together update one row each rather
// than adding rows, and an update that changes nothing publishes nothing.
//
// Items survive a daemon restart, within reason. finished and errored describe
// something that happened and has not been looked at, and that is still true
// after a restart. approval and question describe a prompt on a screen, and the
// process that painted it does not survive the restart, so they are dropped on
// load rather than shown as a question nobody is asking any more. mail is
// dropped too: it points into the message ring, which does not survive, and
// thread ids start again from 1, so a saved item would be merged into whatever
// unrelated thread next took its id. resume is dropped on load as well, because
// the restore that follows every start opens it again from the window's
// recorded conversation, which is where the fact lives.
