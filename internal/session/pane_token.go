// Pane tokens: a second way for a process to say which pane it runs in.
//
// The first way is the kernel's. A unix socket records the pid of the process
// that connected, and the daemon walks that pid up to a pane's shell (see
// peerPaneWindow). Nothing the process sends can change that answer, so it is
// the one restrict-connection trusts first.
//
// Some platforms do not give the peer's pid (Windows, the BSDs), and a process
// can leave its pane's process tree. For those the pane's environment carries
// DARTUIOS_PANE_TOKEN beside DARTUIOS_PANE_ID. The token is an HMAC of the window id
// under a key this daemon picks at start and never writes anywhere, so a token
// names exactly one window of this daemon start, cannot be made for another
// window without the key, and stops working when the daemon restarts.
//
// A token is only as secret as the pane's environment. Any process of the same
// user can read another process's environment on most systems, so a token
// scopes accidents and prompt-injected agents, not a determined local
// attacker. It is why the kernel's answer wins whenever there is one: a
// process the kernel places in pane A cannot become pane B by presenting B's
// token.

// paneTokenBytes is how much of the HMAC a token carries: 128 bits.
