// A theme is the half of the appearance that list-options cannot describe. The
// other 88 settings are scalars with a closed set of values, and the registry
// says what each one takes; a theme is a name drawn from a list of hundreds
// that grows whenever the user writes a file, standing for twenty colours kept
// in a different format in a different directory. Published as a bare string
// option it was undiscoverable and unverifiable at once: nothing said which
// names resolve, and setting one that did not reported success.
//
// This verb is the three questions an agent has to be able to ask about that:
// which themes are there, what is this one actually made of, and is what I just
// chose legible.

// maxThemeList caps how many ids are returned unfiltered. The registry holds
// several hundred and a caller that wants a particular one is better served by
// filtering for it than by paging through them; the total is always reported,
// so a truncated list says so rather than looking complete.
