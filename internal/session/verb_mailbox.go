// messages agents leave for each other, plus the loop guards that keep two
// agents holding each other's address from running away.
//
// The daemon already has an event hub, so the first question was whether it
// already did this. It does not, and the reason is worth writing down: the hub
// delivers only to connections subscribed at the instant of publish and keeps no
// backfill, while an agent drives dartuios through one-shot CLI calls and is almost
// never subscribed. Store-and-forward is the single thing the hub cannot do.
// Everything around it, delivery, filtering and blocking reads, is still the
// hub's, which is why this is a ring and four verbs rather than a broker.
//
// What it deliberately is not: durable. A message dies with the daemon. A
// restored session brings back panes whose shells are new, so a queued
// instruction surviving into one would be addressed to an agent that no longer
// exists and no longer holds the context the instruction assumed. Delivering it
// then is a bug, not a feature.
