//
// Every error envelope may carry a "hint" object alongside its stable code and
// human message. The hint names the thing that resolves the failure: the verb to
// call, the CLI command to run, the parameter that was wrong and what it
// accepts, the closest spelling to what the caller asked for, and the set of
// values that do exist. All fields are omitempty, so an existing consumer that
// only reads code and message is unaffected.

// The closed value sets the protocol accepts. They are the single source of
// truth for both the list-verbs parameter schema and the "accepted" field on an
// invalid_params hint, so the two can never drift apart.
