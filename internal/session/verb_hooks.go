// list-hooks answers the one question the oldest extension point in dartuios could
// not answer: "why does my hook not fire?".
//
// A dock component reports its exit code, when it last ran and its last error,
// which is why "my dock component prints nothing" is answerable. A hook ran
// with its output discarded and its error dropped, so a command that was never
// found and a command that worked looked identical. This reports the table as
// loaded plus the same three facts per command, under the same three names.
//
// It answers for both sides. The daemon fires the hooks for the facts it owns
// and the client fires the ones that need a terminal, so a caller that only saw
// one table would be told a hook does not exist when it does.
