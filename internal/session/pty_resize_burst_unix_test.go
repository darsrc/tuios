// A new pane is resized several times in its first milliseconds, because
// every attached client announces the layout it drew. Each size change is a
// TIOCSWINSZ and so a SIGWINCH for the guest. macOS /bin/bash is bash 3.2.
// While it starts, readline sets LINES and COLUMNS through malloc, and the
// shell's SIGWINCH handler sets them again, also through malloc. A signal
// that lands in that moment deadlocks the shell on its own allocator lock,
// libplatform aborts it ("Trying to recursively lock an os_unfair_lock") and
// the kernel kills it. The pane dies a few milliseconds after it opened.
//
// The PTY now coalesces a burst of resizes: the first one reaches the kernel
// at once, and the rest reach it as one write of the last size once the shell
// has had time to start.
//
// The ways this could fail, written before the change:
//
//  1. The burst still reaches the guest as one SIGWINCH per resize, and bash
//     3.2 dies (the bug). Measured by counting shells killed by a signal.
//  2. The coalesced write never happens, so the guest keeps a size from the
//     middle of the burst while the emulator and every client use the last.
//  3. The first resize is held back, so a pane spawned at the wrong size waits
//     for the burst to end before its guest hears the right one.
//  4. Input typed after a resize reaches the guest before the held size does,
//     so `stty size` run straight after a resize prints the old size.
//  5. The held write fires after Close, against a closed pty.
//  6. Two clients resizing at once race the held size (run under -race).
//
// 1 is TestResizeBurstAtStartupLeavesBash32Alive. 2, 3 and 4 are
// TestResizeBurstReachesTheGuestFirstAndLast. 5 and 6 are the Close after
// each burst and the concurrent resizers in both tests.
