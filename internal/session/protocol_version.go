// This is the binary protocol's half of what verb_compat.go does for the JSON
// verb protocol: both sides announce a version in the handshake, and a peer
// outside the range this build serves is refused with the command that fixes it
// rather than allowed through to fail later as a decode or a hang.
//
// A tagged release is exactly when it bites, because that is when a daemon
// started by the previous version is still holding the socket.

// ProtocolVersion is the wire protocol this build speaks. Both sides announce it
// in the handshake (HelloPayload.Protocol, WelcomePayload.Protocol) and both
// refuse a peer outside the range they serve.
//
// Bump it on any change an older peer cannot read. Appending a message type to
// the end of the iota block is not such a change; inserting one is, because the
// type is a single byte on the wire and every value after the insertion moves.
//
// 3 is this version because exactly that happened since v0.7.0: MsgCapturePane
// was inserted after MsgSetConfig (f0810a1), which moved MsgWelcome from 22 to
// 23 and every server-to-client type with it, while ProtocolVersion stayed at 2.
// A v0.7.0 daemon answers a hello with type 22, which this build reads as
// MsgCapturePane. It was found by building the v0.7.0 tag and pointing this
// client at it. The number is corrected here rather than the numbering reverted,
// because no released build speaks 3 yet, so the bump costs nothing and the
// refusal it enables is the honest outcome for a pairing that cannot work.
