// A worktree session is a session whose directory is a linked git worktree.
// The daemon records which one, so the rail can group it under its repository
// and label it by its branch, and so the worktree verbs can take it away
// again without re-deriving where it came from.
//
// The record has two sources. The worktree verbs write it when they create
// the worktree, and mark it managed: dartuios made it, so dartuios may remove it.
// Every other session gets it by detection from its first window's directory,
// which is read from files and never from git. A detected record follows the
// directory: when the shell moves out of the worktree the record goes with it.
// A managed record does not, because the session is the worktree.

// WorktreeInfo is the daemon's record of a worktree session. It sits on
// SessionState, so it is pushed to every client and saved for resurrection,
// and it is copied onto SessionInfo for the listing.
