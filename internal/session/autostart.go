// it starts the daemon in-process in a background goroutine, and returns nil
// once the daemon is ready or an error if it fails to start.
//
// version is the build of whoever is starting it, which the daemon reports back
// to every client that connects so the two can tell whether they are the same
// build. Empty is allowed and means the caller does not know.
//
// The caller passes the user's [daemon] settings. This package deliberately does not read the
// config file (it would invert the layering, and the daemon outlives every
// process that could own one), so the settings arrive from whoever starts it:
// `dartuios daemon` fills them in runDaemon, and a server does it here.
//
// Without this, a daemon autostarted by dartuios-web ran with the built-in
// defaults while the same daemon autostarted by `dartuios attach` honoured the
// file, so whether agent detection was on came down to which command happened
// to win the start race.
//
// cfg is used only when this call is the one that starts the daemon. An
// already-running daemon keeps the settings it started with, since they are
// its own and it outlives this process.
