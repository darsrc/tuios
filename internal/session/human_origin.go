// Who may act as the person.
//
// The attach nonce (human_sender.go) proves that a sender holds a live attach.
// It does not prove the sender is the person, because any process of the same
// user can attach, and an agent in a pane is such a process. An agent that was
// told, by a file it read or a page it fetched, to "reply to yourself as the
// human" could run dartuios attach in a pseudo-terminal, take the nonce from the
// reply and send a verified answer to its own question.
//
// What separates the person from an agent is where the process runs, and the
// kernel says that on every unix socket connection: the peer's pid, recorded at
// connect time (SO_PEERCRED on Linux, LOCAL_PEERPID on macOS). A process is
// counted as inside a pane of this daemon when any of these holds:
//
//   - the daemon is one of its ancestors. Every pane shell, hook command and
//     popup is a child of the daemon, so this covers all of them and what they
//     start.
//   - its controlling terminal is one of this daemon's pane terminals. That
//     still holds for a process that was orphaned out of a pane, which the
//     ancestry walk loses when the orphan is reparented to init.
//   - its environment names a window of this daemon in DARTUIOS_PANE_ID or
//     DARTUIOS_WINDOW_ID, or this daemon's socket in DARTUIOS_SOCKET. That still
//     holds for an orphan that also left the terminal, and it also places the
//     commands the client starts, its hooks and dock components, which are
//     automation and not the person.
//
// A process that is inside a pane cannot act as the person: send-agent-message
// and ask-agent refuse from=human with forbidden, an attach from it is issued no
// nonce, reading the person's inbox from it does not mark anything read, and a
// state push from a client it runs does not mark a finished turn seen.
//
// A process whose record cannot be read is counted as inside a pane: the
// checks fail closed. A platform where the kernel does not give the peer's pid
// at all (Windows, the BSDs) is the exception: there every caller is treated as
// it was before, and the nonce is the only proof.
//
// This is not a sandbox. A process that leaves the pane on purpose, through a
// service manager, a scheduler, or setsid with a cleaned environment, is not
// inside it by any of these tests. What the checks stop is an agent acting as
// the person through dartuios itself, which is the thing a prompt injection can
// talk it into in one line. docs/AGENT_STATE.md has the whole threat model.
