// The nesting probe.
//
// The process tests in nested_attach.go place a client that runs in a pane,
// or under one. They cannot place a client whose output reaches a pane some
// other way: through ssh to this machine, script run with setsid, or any
// relay that gives it a terminal of its own and drops the pane's variables.
// Such a client still shows the session inside itself. Its size shrinks the
// session to the floor, and it redraws its own pane without end.
//
// What such a client cannot hide is its output, because that output is what
// makes the loop. So a client writes a probe to its terminal before it
// attaches: an OSC sequence no terminal acts on, carrying a random nonce, and
// sends the same nonce with the attach. Every pane's output is scanned for
// probes. When the daemon has seen the client's nonce in a pane, it knows the
// session that pane belongs to, and it places the client there.
//
// A relay that rewrites the screen instead of passing bytes (mosh, tmux) does
// not carry the probe, and a client behind one is not placed.

// nestProbePrefix starts a probe. 7717 is not an OSC number any terminal
// assigns a meaning to, so a terminal that is not a pane ignores it.
