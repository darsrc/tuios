// Fuzzing the tape recorder against the tape parser. The tape manager records
// what the user types into a tape file and plays the file back later, so the
// text a Type line carries has to come back as the text that was typed.
//
// The ways this could fail, written down before the target:
//
//  1. The recorder writes a Type line with Go's %q, which escapes anything
//     strconv does not call printable as \x, \u or \U, and the lexer does not
//     read those escapes: a zero-width joiner in an emoji, a no-break space
//     from a paste, or an escape byte comes back as the letters u200d.
//  2. A NUL in the text ends the string early, because the lexer uses NUL as
//     its end of input.
//  3. The parsed Type command's Raw, which the tape editor writes back out,
//     does not parse to the same text either.
//  4. The recorded tape has a parse error, so playback stops at that line.
