// Ambiguity is a pair of key names that a terminal sends as the same byte, so
// binding one of them binds both.
//
// This is not a dartuios quirk to be worked around. It is what a VT100 keyboard
// was: Ctrl+letter is the letter's code with the top three bits cleared, and
// Tab, Return and Escape happen to sit exactly where Ctrl+I, Ctrl+M and Ctrl+[
// land. Nothing downstream of the terminal can undo that, which is why the only
// thing that changes the answer is the terminal agreeing to send something else.

	// Byte is the control code they all arrive as in the legacy encoding.

	// Why is the one sentence explaining the pair.
	Why string `json:"why"`
	// Separable is whether the Kitty keyboard protocol's disambiguation can
	// tell them apart when the host grants it. All the control-code pairs can
	// be; the pair kept here that cannot is noted in its Why.
