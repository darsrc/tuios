// Unbinding a key is written to config.toml as an empty list on the action:
//
//	[keybindings.terminal_mode]
//	terminal_focus_left = []
//
// An action the file does not mention at all is filled in from the defaults at
// load (fillMapDefaults keys off whether the action is present, not off how
// many keys it has). An action present with an empty list is left alone, so the
// default does not come back on the next load or the next restart. That is the
// whole encoding: absent means "I have no opinion", present-and-empty means "I
// took this away".
//
// The two things a user means by unbinding are both reached from here:
//
//   - Take one key away from dartuios so the program in the pane gets it. That is
//     FreeKey, which strips the key from every action in every scope, because a
//     key half-freed still never reaches the pane.
//   - Leave an action with no key at all. That is UnbindAction, or UnbindKey on
//     the action's last key.
//
// Neither can free the leader key or a key the input path takes without asking
// the config. StillHeldBy says which of those apply, so a caller can report a
// key it did not manage to hand back rather than claiming it did.
