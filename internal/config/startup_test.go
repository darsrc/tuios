// TestAnExistingConfigKeepsTheStartupItWasWritten is the upgrade contract for
// tiled and daemon, and it is the reason both could be turned on at all.
//
// The [startup] booleans have no fill-missing pass, so a file that does not
// name them reads them as false. That is not an oversight here: it means the
// two defaults that change what happens the moment dartuios starts reach a new
// install only. Somebody who already has a config file goes on getting the
// floating, standalone session they had, and the daemon never appears on a
// machine that was not asked for one.
//
// If a fillMissingStartup is ever added, this test fails, and the note in
// docs/SESSIONS.md stops being true on the same day.
