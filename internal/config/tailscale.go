// addresses when you add a host.

//
// It changes what dartuios suggests and nothing else. No machine is ever added on
// its own, no tailnet address is dialled by dartuios itself, and a machine with no
// tailscale on it behaves exactly as it did before this table existed. A host
// added from this list is reached over ssh like every other host, which already
// works across a tailnet because a MagicDNS name resolves like any other name.
//
// It sits outside the option registry for the same reason [hosts] does: the
// per-machine logins are a map of named values rather than a scalar with a
// single settable path.
//
// See internal/federation's tailnet.go for what each field does to the list,
// and `dartuios hosts tailnet` to see the answer for your own tailnet, including
// every machine that was left out and the reason it was.

// TailscaleConfig is the [tailscale] table.

	// false.
