// The [hosts] table names the other machines whose daemons this one links to:
// for listings, and for the connections a client opens to attach a session or
// run a verb there.
//
//	[hosts.build]
//	addr = "gaurav@buildbox"
//
//	[hosts.work]
//	addr = "workstation.local"

//
// It sits outside the option registry for the reason [hooks], [keybindings] and
// [dock.custom] do: it is a map of named tables, not a scalar with a settable
// value, so there is no single path the set-option verb could write.
//
// It is not edited by hand any more, though it still can be. `dartuios hosts add`,
// `dartuios hosts remove` and the Hosts section of the settings page write it, and
// the daemon follows the file, so a change takes effect with no restart. See
// hosts_edit.go for the write and internal/session's daemon_hosts.go for the
// reload.
//
// Discovery of machines is refused on purpose (design document, section 3): a
// host exists because the user named it, and a name resolves exactly or not at
// all. What is offered instead is discovery of what to type: the ssh_config
// Host aliases, as candidates for an addr. See internal/federation's
// sshalias.go.

// HostConfig is one [hosts.NAME] table.
type HostConfig struct {
	// Addr is anything ssh understands, ssh_config aliases included. A host
	// with no addr is ignored, and the daemon logs why.
	Addr string `toml:"addr"`
	// ConnectTimeout is how many seconds one dial may take before the host is
	// called unreachable. Zero uses the built-in default. It is also handed to
	// ssh, so a machine that is powered off is reported rather than waited on.
	ConnectTimeout int `toml:"connect_timeout,omitempty"`
	// Command is the dartuios binary on the far side. Empty means the link finds
	// one itself: on the PATH, at the known install paths, or through the
	// login shell. Set it to run a given binary instead; nothing is then
	// looked for.
	Command string `toml:"command,omitempty"`

	// host that needs a flag ssh_config cannot carry.
	SSHOptions []string `toml:"ssh_options,omitempty"`
	// ReposRoot is the directory on the host where its checkouts live. When
	// a command on this machine names a repository on the host by its origin
	// URL (fan --host, worktree new --host, start-agent -s HOST:SESSION), the
	// host looks for the checkout under it, and clones into it with --clone.
	// Empty lets the host look under its usual source directories. It is a
	// path on the host, written the way the host reads it: absolute, or
	// starting with ~/ for the host's home.
	ReposRoot string `toml:"repos_root,omitempty"`

	// the link arrives at, and an entry that sets only them, with no addr, is
	// a policy and nothing is dialled for it. See link_policy.go.
