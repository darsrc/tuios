// The config file watcher: editing config.toml in one pane takes effect in the
// running dartuios in the next one, with no restart and no reload command.
//
// # Why the directory and not the file
//
// The unit of watching is the directory, and the events are filtered by name.
// An inotify watch on a file follows the inode, and an editor does not write
// through the inode: vim writes a temporary file, renames the original aside
// and renames the new one into place, so the watch ends up on a file nobody
// will ever write to again and the first :w is the last one seen. Watching the
// directory reports the rename, the create and the write, all naming the path,
// and it survives every editor. internal/session's transcript watcher chose the
// directory for the same reason.
//
// # Why the debounce
//
// One save is several events. The rename, the create and the write arrive
// within a few milliseconds of each other, and a reload per event would parse
// the file three times and, worse, parse it once while it was half written.
// Every event restarts a 200 ms timer, so a burst produces one reload after the
// burst is over.
//
// # What a broken file does
//
// Nothing. A file that does not parse or does not validate leaves the running
// config exactly as it is and reports the error, which the client shows on
// screen. A half-written file caught between an editor's two writes is the
// ordinary case of this, and a reload that rendered defaults over a running
// session every time somebody had an unbalanced quote would be far worse than
// waiting for the next save.
//
// # Why some saves are dropped
//
// dartuios writes this file itself: every settings row saves. Without a guard the
// save would come back through the watcher as somebody else's edit, and a held
// arrow key would retile once per repeat for a config already in force. The
// content is hashed, and two hashes are dropped: the one already in force, and
// one dartuios itself wrote (see selfWrites in save.go). The first also drops the
// second and third events of an editor's save when the debounce has not merged
// them.
//
// # What it costs at idle
//
// One descriptor and one goroutine blocked on a channel receive. There is no
// ticker here and none is reachable from here: a file nobody edits produces no
// events, so an idle client pays no wakeups. That is why notification was
// chosen over a poll, and it is what BenchmarkIdleTick measures.

// configDebounce is how long the watcher waits for a save to finish before it
// reads the file.
