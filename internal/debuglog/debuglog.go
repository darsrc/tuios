// Package debuglog opens the diagnostic logs that DARTUIOS_DEBUG_INTERNAL=1
// turns on.
//
// The logs sit at fixed names under /tmp so a developer knows where to look,
// and they carry what a pane printed and, for the events log, every key
// pressed. A fixed name in a shared directory is one another local user can
// create first, as a link to a file of the victim's or as a world-readable
// file of their own, so Open refuses both and keeps the file private. The
// render trace, whose name under the temp directory is just as predictable,
// opens through it too.
