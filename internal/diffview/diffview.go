// Package diffview draws the lines of a diff: syntax highlighting by file
// type, line numbers in a gutter, added and removed lines on tinted grounds,
// the changed part of a changed line marked, and a side by side layout.
//
// The design follows the diff view of Crush (github.com/charmbracelet/crush,
// internal/ui/diffview): chroma picks a lexer from the file name and
// tokenises the code, every token is drawn with its colour on the ground of
// the line it sits on so no cell is left without a background, and a
// changed line is paired with the line it replaced for the split layout. No
// code is copied from Crush, whose licence (FSL-1.1-MIT) is not yet MIT for
// any version of that view. What differs here: the colours come from the
// active dartuios theme rather than a fixed style, the lines of one side of a
// hunk are tokenised together so a comment or string that spans lines keeps
// its colour, and the part of a line that changed is marked.
//
// The package draws; it does not lay out. The caller decides which rows are
// on screen and asks for those only, so a file of five thousand lines costs
// the rows that show. Tokenising is the expensive part, so the caller asks
// for a chunk of lines at a time and keeps what Highlight returned for as
// long as the diff does not change.
//
// The browser build (GOOS=js) leaves chroma out and draws every line plain:
// it never shows a review, and the lexers would add megabytes to the page.
