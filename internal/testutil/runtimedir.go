// names neither the path nor the length, so the failure reads like a broken
// socket rather than a long one.

// starts a daemon, short enough that the socket path inside it still fits in a

//
// t.TempDir is not short enough on macOS. It roots at $TMPDIR, which is a
// per-user path under /var/folders about 49 characters long, and it appends
// the test's own name, so a long test name reaches 130 characters before the
// socket name is added. Every daemon test in
// the tree failed that way, and the error named the symptom rather than the
// cause.
//
// The directory is created under /tmp, which is short on both platforms that
// have unix sockets, and removed when the test ends.
