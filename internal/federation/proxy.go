// It writes the preamble, then reads frames from in and writes frames to out.
// Every stream the hub opens gets its own connection to the local daemon
// socket, and bytes are copied both ways until either side ends.
//
// It never starts a daemon, because starting a daemon restores that machine's
// saved sessions: a side effect on remote state that nobody on that machine
// asked for. A host with no daemon running reports
// itself that way instead, which is a true and useful answer.
//
// It returns when in ends, which is what happens when the hub closes the link
// or ssh drops.

	// something, which made the write fail, which ended the other copy, which
	// finally released the close.
