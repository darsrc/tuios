// Finding dartuios on the far side.
//
// ssh runs a command through a non-interactive shell, and that shell's PATH is
// the system default: /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin and their friends. It is not the
// PATH the person sees at their prompt, because the profile that adds
// ~/.local/bin is only read by a login shell. The project's own install script
// puts dartuios in ~/.local/bin, so the default install location was one the
// default link could not find, and every such host needed --command to work.
//
// The link now finds the binary itself. The whole mechanism is one shell
// script sent as the remote command, which tries three things in order and
// then runs what it found with the arguments the link wanted to run:
//
//  1. Plain `dartuios` on the PATH. Free, and right on most machines.
//  2. A fixed list of places dartuios is installed. Each is one stat, nothing is
//     searched, and the list is bounded so a person can read it when it fails.
//  3. The person's login shell, asked what `dartuios` means to it. This is the
//     step that reads the profile. It is last because it is the expensive one:
//     a profile can take seconds, can print, and differs between shells. The
//     fixed list resolves every install the project knows about without paying
//     that, so the login shell only runs on a machine where dartuios is somewhere
//     unusual, which is exactly where its answer is worth the cost.
//
// The script prints which path it chose on a line ahead of the link preamble,
// so the hub can report it and can run it directly on the next dial. A
// configured command skips all of this: it is sent as written, exactly as it
// always was.
