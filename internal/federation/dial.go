// section 7 forbids. So the daemon's links never prompt: an unknown host key or
// a missing key fails immediately and `dartuios hosts` reports it with ssh's own
// words. The user resolves it once by running ssh themselves.

// powered-off host is reported rather than leaving a process parked until the
// context expires.

// The keepalive settings.
//
// A link to a cloud host sits idle whenever nobody types, and an idle TCP
// connection through a NAT or a stateful firewall is dropped without either end
// being told. ssh notices only when something tries to write, which for an
// attached session is the next keystroke: the person types, and the link they
// were using turns out to have been dead for twenty minutes. That is the
// failure these three options exist to stop.
//
// ServerAliveInterval sends an encrypted probe when the connection has been
// quiet that long. Fifteen seconds is chosen against the two numbers that
// matter. Middlebox idle timeouts start around thirty seconds at the
// aggressive end, so the probe has to be comfortably under that to hold the
// mapping open. And the cost is four small packets a minute per host, which a
// laptop radio does not notice; going to sixty seconds would save nothing worth
// having and would sit above the timeouts that cause this.
//
// ServerAliveCountMax is how many unanswered probes end the connection, so the
// pair decides how long a dead path stays undetected: 15 x 3 is forty-five
// seconds. Detection is what starts the client's reconnect, so it is a floor on
// how long a person stares at a frozen pane. Three is the smallest count that
// still rides out a couple of lost packets on a mobile link, which is what
// stops a brief drop-out from being reported as a dead host.
//
// TCPKeepAlive is the kernel's own probe. It is redundant with the two above
// while the link is up and it is not redundant when ssh is blocked writing:
// it is what makes the socket fail rather than block forever.
