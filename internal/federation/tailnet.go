// Address discovery on a tailnet: the machines a user could reasonably type as
// a host's addr, read from the tailscaled already running on this machine.
//
// This is the same idea as sshalias.go and obeys the same rule. Nothing is
// added automatically, and a host exists only because the user named it
// (federation design, section 3). What is offered is a list of names to pick
// from, so nobody has to remember what a machine is called or type out a
// MagicDNS name by hand.
//
// It reads and never writes. The only call made is `tailscale status --json`,
// which needs no root and no operator setting: the local API grants read to
// any connection on the socket. If tailscaled is
// not running, or the machine is not on a tailnet, the list is empty and
// nothing else changes.
//
// Nothing here dials a tailnet address. A machine offered from this list is
// reached the same way every other host is, by ssh, which already works over a
// tailnet because MagicDNS names resolve like any other name. The tailnet is
// how the name resolves and how the traffic is carried, not a second transport
// inside dartuios.
