// Address discovery: the names a user could reasonably type as a host's addr.
//
// An addr is anything ssh understands, and the thing most people already have
// is an ssh_config alias. Reading ~/.ssh/config for its Host names turns "what
// do I type here" into a list to pick from, without dartuios guessing anything.
//
// Three rules keep this honest, and they are the whole design.
//
// Only the Host keyword is read. known_hosts is never opened, no key file is
// ever opened, and no value other than an alias is taken from the file: an
// alias is a label the user chose, and it is the one thing in the ssh
// configuration that is safe to show back to them.
//
// Nothing is added automatically. The list is offered, and a host exists only
// because the user named it. That is section 3 of the federation design, which
// refuses discovery as a way of finding machines; this is discovery of what to
// type, not of what to connect to.
//
// An alias found here is never written anywhere but the user's own config file,
// and only by a command the user ran.

// maxSSHAliases bounds the list. A generated ssh config can hold thousands of
// hosts, and a completion list that long helps nobody.
