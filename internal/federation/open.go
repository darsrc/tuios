// Nothing here crosses the daemon's link. The link carries listings and refuses
// writes, and that rule is unchanged. What this file builds is the argv of a
// plain interactive ssh that runs dartuios on the far side, so the session is
// attached by the remote dartuios in a local terminal or pane. That is the
// tmux-over-ssh a person already types, spelled from the [hosts] table so the
// address, the options and the remote binary are typed once.
//
// Two things are deliberately not the link's: the ssh has a tty, so the far
// side can draw, and BatchMode is off, so ssh may ask a question. A pane can
// answer a prompt. A daemon cannot, which is why the link forbids them.

// the tests use to put a stand-in on the far end of every link and every open.

// A plain word passes as is. A word with spaces or other characters is wrapped
// in single quotes, which every login shell dartuios can be attached from reads

// fish escape those differently inside single quotes, and there is no spelling
