// Replacing a binary that is running.
//
// A daemon is very likely executing the exact file being replaced, and on Linux
// writing to a running executable fails outright with ETXTBSY. Renaming over it
// does not: the running process keeps the inode it already opened and the name
// points at the new file, which is what every installer in this repository
// already does. The rename has to happen inside the target's own directory,
// because a rename across filesystems is not a rename at all and os.Rename
// fails with EXDEV.
//
// Staged is the pair of steps that arrangement needs: write the bytes next to
// the target, then move them onto it.

// Staged is a new binary written beside the file it will replace, not yet in
// place.
