// Package release finds published dartuios releases and turns one into a verified
// binary on disk.
//
// It exists as its own package for one reason: the lookup has to be faked in
// tests. A release check that reached api.github.com from `go test` would be a
// test that fails on a plane, fails behind a proxy, and fails when the rate
// limit is spent, so Source is an interface and the GitHub client is one
// implementation of it.
//
// Nothing here decides whether an update should happen. That is provenance.go's
// job, and it is deliberately separate: knowing what the newest release is and
// knowing whether this particular binary is ours to replace are different
// questions, and the second one is the one that has to be answered first.
//
// The GitHub client lives in github.go, which the browser build leaves out: a
// browser tab never updates dartuios, and net/http is a large part of a download.
