//go:build differential

package vt_test

// A differential test against tmux.
//
// Every other test in this package states what the emulator should do in the
// words of whoever wrote the test, which means a case can be wrong in exactly
// the same way the code is. An independent implementation cannot be. tmux has
// its own VT emulator, written in C, with no shared ancestry with the parser
// here, and it can be driven headlessly: start a pane running `cat` on a file
// of bytes, then ask tmux to print the resulting screen.
//
// It is behind a build tag because it needs the tmux binary and spawns
// processes, which does not belong in the default suite. Run it with:
//
//	go test -tags differential ./internal/vt/ -run TestDifferential -v
//
// A disagreement is a finding, not automatically a bug here: tmux is an
// implementation with its own choices, not a specification. Cases where tmux is
// the one that diverges are listed in tmuxDiffers with the reason, so the test
// stays useful instead of being switched off.

	"wrap then backspace": "tmux lets the cursor sit one column past the last one and " +

		"its CursorBack clears the flag and then moves back one, landing a column earlier. " +
		"ghostty and every terminal that follows xterm's model agree with this one",

	"restore a pending wrap": "the same root cause as the backspace above. tmux has no " +
		"pending-wrap flag to save, so a DECSC taken at the end of a full line and " +
		"restored has nothing to restore and the next character overwrites the last one " +
		"instead of starting a new line. xterm lists the wrap flag among what DECSC saves",

	"insert splitting a wide character": "tmux declines to insert inside a double-width " +
		"character and shifts from the cell after it instead, which silently moves the " +
		"insertion point the program asked for. This one blanks the character the insert " +
		"splits, which is what ghostty does and what the rest of this emulator already " +
		"does for a wide character cut by a resize or an overwrite",

	"forward tab several stops": "tmux does not implement CHT at all and leaves the cursor " +
		"where it was; xterm has had it since the VT100 and terminfo reaches it through `cht`",

	"tab with a zero parameter": "same as above: tmux ignores CHT, so the zero-means-one " +
		"rule never comes up for it",

	"delete splitting a wide character": "tmux leaves the row untouched rather than delete " +
		"inside a double-width character, so the program's delete silently does nothing. " +
		"Same reasoning as the insert above",

	"selective erase below": "tmux does not implement DECSED and erases nothing. xterm and " +
		"ghostty erase every cell DECSCA has not protected, and on a screen with nothing " +
		"protected that is exactly what ED erases, which is what this emulator does",

	"selective erase in line": "tmux does not implement DECSEL either; same reasoning as " +
		"DECSED above, with EL in place of ED",

	"position backward": "tmux ignores HPB (CSI j) and leaves the cursor where it was. " +
		"ECMA-48 defines it as the backward move opposite HPR, and ghostty implements it " +
		"as CUB, which is what this emulator does. xterm's ctlseqs does not list it",
