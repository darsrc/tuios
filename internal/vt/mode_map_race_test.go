// The mode map is written from one goroutine and read from another, and a Go
// map read racing a map write is not a data race the program survives: the
// runtime throws "concurrent map read and map write", which is a fatal error no
// recover can catch. The emulator runs in the daemon process, so that takes
// every pane in every session down together rather than the one pane that
// misbehaved.
//
// TestModeConcurrentAccess already covers the accessors that were guarded when
// modesMu was introduced. This covers the other side: the guest-facing
// sequences that read the map on the parser goroutine while the session layer
// restores a snapshot on its own. internal/session/session.go calls
// RestoreModes on every reattach, and internal/input reaches for the same
// entries, so the two goroutines are the real ones rather than a contrived
// pair.
