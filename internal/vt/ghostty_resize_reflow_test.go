// The report behind them: "on every resize, the ghostty pty adds an empty new
// line". It does, but nothing in the emulator invents the line. A shell that
// draws a prompt filling the pane to its last column, then repaints on
// SIGWINCH by stepping up a fixed number of rows, is off by one the moment
// reflow splits that full-width line in two. fish's default prompt truncates
// the path to exactly the terminal width, so in a pane narrow enough to
// truncate, every prompt is full width and every narrowing resize costs a
// line. A wide pane never triggers it, because the path fits.

// path-truncating prompt does.

// somewhere. Ghostty rewraps it onto a second row and keeps every character;
// the pure emulator has no reflow and drops the characters that no longer

// TestGhosttyResizeCostsALinePerShrinkWhenAShellRepaints is the reported bug,

// and reversible (see above); the pure emulator simply never reflows, which
// is why it happens to agree with the shell. The line is lost because the
// shell steps up a fixed number of rows to repaint a prompt that reflow has
// made one row taller.
//
// Ghostty's own answer to this is the OSC 133 redraw extension: on resize it
// blanks the prompt area so the shell can repaint it cleanly. libghostty's C
// API turns that off at construction ("embedders don't necessarily install
// Ghostty's shell integration"), which is why dartuios does not get it and a
// ghostty window does. Enabling it clears the stale rows but not the extra
