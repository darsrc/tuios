// Conformance for tab stops: HT, HTS, TBC, CHT and CBT.
//
// Tabs are how a shell lines up completion columns and how `ls` lays out a
// directory, so a terminal that gets them wrong produces ragged output for the
// commands people run most. They also survive a resize, which is where a stop
// table can quietly go stale.
//
// Cases follow esctest tests/{ht,hts,tbc,cht,cbt}.py, the VT510 reference
// manual entries for the same, and xterm's TabZonk/TabSet in charproc.c.
