// These are the sequences where being wrong is invisible on screen and obvious

// transposed will draw its prompt in the wrong place forever after, and nothing
// in a screen-dump test would ever notice.
//
// Cases are drawn from esctest (iTerm2's conformance suite,
// tests/esctest/esctest/tests/{cpr,decrqm,dsr}.py), from the VT510 reference
// manual entries for CPR, DECXCPR, DECRQM and DA, and from what xterm's
// charproc.c actually sends for CASE_DSR.
