// TestWidthMethod_MatchesHowCharactersAreActuallyPlaced covers a disagreement
// the emulator had with itself.
//
// The emulator satisfies uv.Screen, and ultraviolet asks a screen which width
// method it uses before building a cell to write into it. The placement path
// measures every cluster with ansi.GraphemeWidth and always has. WidthMethod
// answered ansi.WcWidth unless DEC mode 2027 was on, so a cell built by
// ultraviolet for this screen could be one column narrower than the cell the
// emulator would have written for the same text.
//
// One column is the whole bug. A wrong width on a cluster shifts everything
// after it along the row, and in a multiplexer the column it shifts into
// belongs to the pane next door.
