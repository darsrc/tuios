// Kitty's Unicode placeholder protocol, and the one thing a multiplexer has to
// do about it.
//
// An application that wants an image to move with the text does not place the
// image itself. It transmits the image, creates a virtual placement saying the
// image occupies a box of c columns by r rows, and then prints cells of
// U+10EEEE where the image should appear. The terminal draws the part of the
// image that belongs to each of those cells. Because the position lives in the
// text grid, the image scrolls, reflows and clips exactly as the text does,
// which is why kitty's own documentation points multiplexers at this protocol.
//
// Each placeholder cell carries the image id in its foreground colour: the low
// 24 bits as the red, green and blue channels, and the top 8 bits, when the id
// needs them, in a third combining mark. The first mark is the image row and
// the second is the column; a cell with no marks continues the run to its left.
//
// dartuios has to rewrite that id. The image the host holds is not the image the
// guest transmitted: guests pick ids independently and two panes would collide,
// so every image is re-registered under an id dartuios allocates. The cells still
// name the guest's id, and a cell naming an id the host has never heard of
// draws nothing. Translating the colour is the whole of the work, and it is why
// this lives in the emulator rather than in the passthrough: the cells are text
// and the emulator is what owns the text.

// a cell with no marks is the cell to its left, one column on. That is fine
// until something takes the left of the row away, and a multiplexer takes the
// left of rows away constantly. A pane dragged off the left edge of the screen
// is clipped there, and a window drawn over the left half of an image replaces
// those cells with its own. Either way the leftmost surviving cell has nothing
// to inherit from, and kitty's specification says so outright: the rules "will
// not work for horizontal scrolling and overlapping images", and a terminal
// may guess but does not have to.
//
// So the marks are filled in here, where the row is still whole. Every cell is
// given its own row and column, which is what the cell to its left would have
// told it, and then no cell needs a neighbour and any of them can be clipped
