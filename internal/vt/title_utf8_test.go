// TestTitleFromGuest drives OSC 2 through the emulator, which is the path a
// guest takes.
//
// A title is chrome: it is drawn in a rail row, a window frame and a session
// listing, and it is serialised into JSON. An invalid byte survives all of
// that as a replacement character, which draws as a tofu box and marshals as
// U+FFFD, so one bad byte from a guest put a black diamond in three places at
// once. The guard must drop only the bad bytes: multi-byte characters and a
// real U+FFFD, which is three valid bytes, stay.
//
// Only the first ';' separates the command from the data, so a title holding a
// semicolon keeps it.
//
// Negative control: taking the OSC payload as a string leaves the title
// invalid and the bad-byte cases fail.
