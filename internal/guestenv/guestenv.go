// it picks no image protocol for it, no keyboard workaround, the same resize
// limits and the same link style. The other names would have Codex, and the

// terminal and say nothing about what the pane in front of it will carry.

// So dartuios says. It has already probed the host, and this is that answer,
// which is also why the variable is the same one that overrides the probe: a
// dartuios running inside a dartuios pane should believe the pane it is in.
//
// Only the local terminal path sets it so far. The daemon builds its own guest

// notifications in tmux DCS passthrough, which dartuios drops, and an agent that
// splits panes through tmux reaches the outer tmux instead of the pane it is
// in. The pane is a dartuios pane, so these are removed.
//
// The same holds for an enclosing herdr. HERDR_ENV and the pane ids name the
// herdr pane dartuios runs in: Crush, and herdr's own hooks, report to it when
// they see them, so an agent in a dartuios pane would set the state of the outer
// herdr pane. HERDR_SOCKET_PATH stays, since it names herdr's server and says
// nothing about which pane a process is in; a pane dartuios tells about its own
// herdr protocol socket gets it replaced (see session.Manager.HerdrEnv).
//
// An enclosing dartuios is the same case. A daemon or a standalone dartuios started
// from a dartuios pane inherits that pane's DARTUIOS_ variables, and its own panes
// would name the outer pane, session and socket where they set none of their
// own. The ones a pane sets for itself are set again after this filter.
