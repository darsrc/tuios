// Package risk marks a tool call an agent asks to have approved as risky: a
// command that deletes recursively, force pushes, pipes a download to a shell,
// writes outside the worktree, and the like.
//
// It is a speed bump, not a sandbox. A rule reads the command as a person
// would type it, so a command built to hide what it does (a variable holding
// "rm", an alias, a script file, base64 piped to a shell that no rule sees as
// a download) passes. The harness's own permission system stays the boundary;
// what this package adds is that the Inbox asks for a second, deliberate
// press before it allows a call a rule matched.
//
// Match is pure: it reads the call and the rules and nothing else, so the
// daemon can run it under its own locks.
