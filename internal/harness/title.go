// The pane's window title as evidence, and the one rule that makes it safe to
// read.
//
// A title is a short string the program publishes about itself with OSC 0 or
// OSC 2, and the agents already use it: Claude Code puts a spinner there while
// it works, Codex writes "Action Required" there when it is blocked. dartuios
// parsed the sequence and kept the string for the window's name, and no tier
// ever looked at it.
//
// The catch is what a title is made of. A screen is prose, so matching a
// substring anywhere in it is right. A title is mostly paths, branches and
// program names, and a substring test against those finds the agent's own name
// inside words that are not it: a pane sitting in ~/src/opencode-blinker
// matches a rule for "opencode", and the false positive arrives wearing the
// right label. So a title predicate has to match a whole token.

// tokenByte reports whether b continues a word. The hyphen is in here, which is
// the whole point: "opencode-blinker" has to fail a rule for "opencode", and it
// only fails if the hyphen is a letter as far as the boundary is concerned.
// Paths are split on their separators because a rule for a program name should
// still match ~/bin/opencode.

// empty string is asking for every pane, which is what checkRule refuses a
// rule with no predicates for.

// at that end, because the boundary it would be held to is already written
// into the rule. That is what lets a rule say "] " or "> " and mean it.
