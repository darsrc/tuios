// It is data rather than code because it differs by harness and changes by
// release, and a user whose harness submits on a different key should be able
// to say so in a file. Every field has a default that is right for a TUI in raw
// mode, so a manifest that says nothing gets the behaviour dartuios had before
// this block existed.
//
// Source says where the values came from, in words, so a reader can tell a
// measured fact from a documented one and both from a guess.
