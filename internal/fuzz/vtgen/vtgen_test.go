// brokenTerm stands in for the emulator as it was before the scroll region was
// clamped to the screen. It implements exactly the bug and nothing else: it
// takes the bottom row a guest names at face value, and the first scroll inside
// that region indexes past the end of its buffer.
//
// This is here as a calibration weight. A generator that never finds a bug is
// indistinguishable from a generator that never generates anything, and the
// only way to tell them apart is to hand it a bug that is known to exist and
// known to be reachable, and check that it comes back with it. The bug chosen
// is the real one: a scroll region sized for a taller terminal, which is what
// crashed the harness this project tests with, and what crashed this emulator.
