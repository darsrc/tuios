// Shrinking is what decides whether this fuzzer's output is usable. A raw
// failing run is 2000 actions of noise around the three that matter, and nobody
// reads that. vtgen.Reduce runs the passes to a fixpoint: delete a block,
// delete a single action, then simplify what is left in place, and stop when a
// whole round changes nothing.
//
// still is the oracle: it replays a candidate from a clean target and reports
// whether the same rule still breaks. Every pass is a guess that is kept only
// when still agrees, so the result is guaranteed to reproduce.

// shrink returns the smallest sequence it could reach that still fails.
//
// The simplify pass reduces the actions that survive. A repro reading
// `resize 0 0` is a statement about degenerate sizes; the same repro reading
// `resize 137 29` says nothing, even though both reproduce. Each candidate
// replacement is tried in order from most to least aggressive and the first
// one that still fails wins.
