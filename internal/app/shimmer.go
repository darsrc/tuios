// The shimmer is a band of light that sweeps across the name of an agent row
// on the rail while that agent is working. The glyph beside the row already
// says "working"; what the glyph cannot say is that the agent is alive right
// now, and a static glyph looks the same on an agent that is busy and on one
// that hung an hour ago. Codex draws its "Working" header this way, and this is
// its algorithm (codex-rs/tui/src/shimmer.rs):
//
//   - one clock for the whole process, so every row on screen sweeps in step;
//   - the band crosses the text plus ten columns of run-up on each side every
//     two seconds, so there is a pause between sweeps;
//   - within five columns of the band's centre the intensity is a raised
//     cosine, 0.5 * (1 + cos(pi * d / 5)), and zero outside.
//
// In truecolor a cell's ink is carried toward the accent by the intensity. At
// 256 and 16 colours a blend would snap between unrelated colours, so the
// intensity picks an attribute instead, as Codex does: faint below 0.2, the
// row's own weight below 0.6, bold above. The row as a whole reads a little
// quieter and a bright band crosses it.
//
// Who sees it. Only a row in the rail's agents section, and only while that
// pane's agent state is working. Somebody who never runs an agent has no such
// row, so the shimmer never draws, the motion clock never starts, and the rail
// cache is never touched. It is decoration, so it is appearance.motion = full
// only, and --no-animations turns it off with everything else.
//
// What it costs. The pass runs on the canvas right after the rail's layer is
// drawn (see composeLayers). The rail's rows stay cached: the span of each
// working name is recorded when the rows are built and kept with them, and the
// pass rewrites the style of those cells and no others. A frame drawn for the
// shimmer re-renders no pane and rebuilds no rail, and the clock asks for 15 of
// them a second.
