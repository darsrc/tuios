// A BSP tree is built by a client and needed by every client on the session:
// it is what the dividers between shared-border panes are read from, and it is
// what the next retile lays the panes out from. The daemon never builds one; it
// stores whichever a client last pushed and hands it on.
//
// This test holds two full clients on one session and watches what one
// client's tree does to the other's.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROL: adoptTopology answering true for every sync, so the echo
// gate is gone: TestAPeerKeepsItsOwnTreeAgainstADaemonEcho fails saying a
// same-version echo from the daemon replaced the stacked tree with the
// side-by-side one.

// treeShape renders a client's tree for the current workspace with the panes
// named by their PTYs rather than by int IDs, so two clients' trees can be
// compared whatever numbers each handed out.
