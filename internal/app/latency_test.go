// Input latency, decomposed.
//
// "Input latency" is not one number. The path a keystroke takes crosses a
// socket, a PTY, a guest, a ring buffer, a socket again, an emulator, a
// coalescer and a compositor, and the hop that dominates is not the one people
// assume. e2e/tui/perf_test.go measures the whole loop honestly, against the
// real binary in a real PTY, but a single end-to-end number cannot say which
// hop to go and fix. These measurements cut the same path into pieces.
//
// The rig is the rehydration rig: a real Daemon in this process, a real
// TUIClient over its socket, and a real OS restored through the attach path.
// Nothing is stubbed.
//
// What every number here INCLUDES: the client's write to the daemon socket, the
// daemon's read and PTY write, the guest, the daemon's ring append and
// broadcast, the client's read loop, the outputWriter batch into the client
// emulator, the render coalescer, and composeFrame.
//
// What every number here EXCLUDES: the host terminal's own input handling,
// bubbletea's stdin decode into a KeyPressMsg, and the final write of the diff
// to the host tty. Those three are what the e2e number adds on top, and the gap
// between the two harnesses is how much they cost.
