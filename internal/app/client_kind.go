// ClientKind names where the person looking at the screen is sitting. It is
// the one fact the three entry points differ on, and everything below that
// used to be a boolean each of them set by hand.
//
// A client is built with a kind and NewOS derives the rest: whether the
// settings page may write the config file, whether the process shares a desktop
// with the user, how graphics reach the terminal. A flag derived from the kind
// cannot be set on one client and forgotten on another, which is how the same
// server shipped read-only for the browser and writable over SSH once.
//
// The zero value is a client nobody named. The tests and the benchmarks build
// those, and they get no derivation and no watcher: exactly the struct the
// options describe.
