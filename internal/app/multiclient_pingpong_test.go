// its layout, B reads rectangles that do not fit its box and pushes its own, A
// reads those and pushes again, and neither ever runs out of things to say. The
// rectangles are the argument and every round trip is a resize of a real shell.

// So a client may not push a layout it worked out because it disagreed with a
// peer's. It may push one thing from inside a sync (a window the daemon asked
// it to place, which is an answer rather than an echo), and that answer is
// terminal: the peer applying it has nothing left to place and so has nothing
// to say back.

// in SyncStateToDaemon and letting ApplyStateSync's re-layout push (the shape
// of fix this area invites) turns this into an exchange that does
