// Two orderings a client used to get wrong, each pinned by making it happen on
// purpose. Both are deterministic race regressions: the interleaving is built
// step by step against a real daemon, not waited for.
//
// The first is a push crossing a broadcast. A client pushes its state while a
// peer's broadcast is already on its way to it, and applies the broadcast
// afterwards. The daemon holds the client's push and sends it to every other
// client, but never back to the client that made it, so that client alone is
// left on the peer's older view for good. The convergence harness met it as a
// pane zoomed on two clients and not on the third, about one sequence in two
// hundred under load, once it stopped losing broadcasts of its own.
//
// The second is two copies of the session state arriving in the opposite order
// to the one they were taken in. The daemon sends from more than one goroutine,
// so it can happen, and a client that applied the older copy last dropped a
// window the daemon had just opened.
//
// How these could pass without the fix, written down first:
//   - The broadcast could be applied before the push instead of after it, which
//     is the order that was always right. The test holds the broadcast in the
//     exchange until the daemon is seen to hold the push.
//   - The daemon could have merged the two pushes into one state both sides
//     already agree with. The two pushes change the same pane in opposite
//     directions, so the last one has to win on every client.
//   - The client could be compared with a peer that is wrong the same way. It
//     is compared with the daemon's own newest state as well.
//   - The two copies could be the same state, so the order would not matter.
//     The older one lacks the window the newer one has.

// newestDaemonState records the newest state the daemon has broadcast to the
// rig's control connection.
