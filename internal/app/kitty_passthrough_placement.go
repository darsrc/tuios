		// the gesture settles, see resize_deferral.go). Re-clipping and re-placing
		// the same stale image against each intermediate viewport size makes it
		// visibly crop and jitter many times a second: the flicker. So while a
		// window is being manipulated AND its size differs from the size the
		// placement was last laid out at, the existing placement is left exactly
		// where it is (kitty keeps the last a=p on screen), and no delete or
		// re-place is emitted for it.
		//
		// resizeFreezeSize records the size seen on the PREVIOUS pass, and is
		// written on every pass. The hold is therefore keyed on the size still
		// moving, not on how the gesture ends: while the pointer drags, each tick
		// differs from the last and the image is held; the tick after the pointer
		// stops matches the last one and the image re-places once at the settled
		// geometry. A plain window move (manipulated, unchanged size) is never
		// frozen and still follows the pointer.
		//
		// Keying it on the flag instead stretches a browser pane. The flag is
		// cleared by mouse release, and release is the event that goes missing
		// when the pointer leaves the surface mid-drag. That is the case
		// clearStaleManipulation exists for, and the one that sweep skips while
		// InteractionMode is set. A hold released only by that flag then outlives
		// its gesture forever, and a frozen pane is not an idle one: the guest has
		// been resized, redraws at its new size and keeps streaming frames, every
		// one of which is forwarded to the host as a fresh bitmap for the same
		// image id. With no placement to go with them the host keeps scaling each
		// new bitmap into the pre-resize cell rectangle. Measured on a 120x40
		// screen whose pane was dragged from 118 to 78 content columns: the host
		// held c=118,r=38 while every frame arriving was 780px wide, a 1.51x
		// horizontal stretch that lasted until a click (press sets the flag,
		// release clears it on every window) let the correct c=78,r=38 out.
		// Keyed on the CONTENT rectangle, not the outer one. The two do not
		// move together: dragging a tiled pane untiles it for the length of
		// the gesture (untilePaneForDrag), which leaves the outer rectangle
		// exactly where it was and takes a border's worth off every edge of the
		// content. Watching the outer rectangle sees nothing happen, so the
		// hold never arms and the placement is recomputed against a content
		// area two cells narrower and two shorter than the bitmap the host is
		// holding: the image jumps a cell and loses its right-hand and bottom
		// edges for the length of a drag. The content rectangle is also the
