// offered on every session row while only ever acting on the attached one: the
// row carried its session all the way to the menu, and the actions the menu
// dispatched addressed the client's own session whatever row they came from.
// The rows were dimmed everywhere else to cover for it. These pin the fix, which
// is that the row decides and the confirmation says which session it means.

// killSessionOS is a client attached to session-1 (three panes) with another
// session, "docs", renamed to "Payments API" on screen and holding two panes,
// one of them mid-task. The listing is seeded rather than fetched: what is being
// tested is what the menu and the dialog do with a session this client is not
// in, not the wire underneath.
