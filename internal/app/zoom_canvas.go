// Zooming a pane to less than the whole screen is a camera move, not a resize.
//
// The first cut of appearance.zoom_size grew the one pane toward the screen and
// left the others at their tiles, so what showed around it was whatever happened
// to lie under the edges: on a full-height pane beside a stack of two, a few
// rows of somebody else's title bar at each end. It read as litter rather than
// as a view of anything.
//
// The layout is laid out on a canvas larger than the screen instead, and the
// screen is panned to the pane you zoomed. Every pane keeps its place and its
// proportions relative to every other; the zoomed one is simply the one the
// camera is on, and its neighbours run off the edges because the canvas is
// bigger than the window you are looking through it with. It is the scrolling
// layout's strip in two directions, which is what it was asked to be.
//
// The scale is whatever makes the zoomed pane reach zoom_size percent of the
// screen, so a small pane in a busy layout is lifted further than a big one:
// the setting says how much of the screen the pane you asked for should take,
// and that is the same promise whatever it started as.
//
// The tiler is run again in the larger box rather than its finished rectangles
// being stretched. Stretching them scaled the gaps between panes along with the
// panes, and a gap is not content: it is the one column a shared border is
// drawn in. At any zoom past about 1.5x that column became two, which drew fat
// dividers under BSP and, under master-stack, none at all, because the divider
// finder looks for neighbours exactly one gap apart. Laying out in the larger
// box keeps every gap the width the user asked for, so the dividers come out
// right without anything downstream knowing a camera is involved.

// zoomPeekMinCells is the least a neighbour may show on a side the zoomed pane
// has one on.
//
// Two cells: its border and one cell of what is behind it. One cell is the
// border alone, which says a pane is there without showing any of it, and on a
// bordered layout it reads as a stray line rather than as a pane carrying on
// past the edge of the screen.

	// the region on an axis cannot be lifted on it: growing the box vertically
	// for the left half of a split would push that pane's own top and bottom
	// off the screen, which loses the pane you asked to see. Each axis is
	// floored at the region's own size, so an axis with nothing to gain is left
	// alone and the lift happens on the axis that has room for it.
	//
	// The box is stretched differently in the two directions when that happens.
