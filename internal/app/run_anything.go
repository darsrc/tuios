// POSIX single-quoting is a string literal to PowerShell and nothing at all to
// cmd.exe, and in a daemon session the daemon's shell is not even knowable from
// here. Exec'ing sends the argv with the NewWindow request itself, on both the
// local and the daemon path, so there is no quoting and no pane to find after
// the fact. The trade is that the pane closes when the program exits, which is
// what every pane does when its process ends.

// input queue and the shell's line editor reads them when it starts, the same
// way a keystroke that beat the prompt has always been handled. That is what
// makes this cost no timer. The earlier version of this path polled on a
// tea.Tick for a pane to appear and then guessed at a settle delay; both are
