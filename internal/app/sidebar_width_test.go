// looking at, and it already has a home of its own in the sidebar state file.
//
// Adopting it from session state made the rail a property of whatever you were
// attached to: hop to a session on another machine and the rail changed width,
// because you inherited whatever width the last person to use that session left
// it at. Nothing about your screen changed, so nothing about your rail should.
//
// Negative control: restoring the adopt makes this fail with 24, the width the
// incoming session carries.
