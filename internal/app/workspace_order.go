// The dock's workspace pills can be dragged into any arrangement, and what that
// arrangement is has one careful answer.
//
// A workspace's number is its identity. It is what the window's Workspace field
// carries, what WorkspaceFocus and WorkspaceTrees are keyed by, what leader+1..9
// and opt+1..9 press, what every verb takes, what DARTUIOS_WORKSPACE exports to a
// hook, and what a resurrected session comes back addressed by. Renumbering on a
// drag would have to move all of that at once and would break every one of those
// addresses for a gesture that meant "put this one first".
//
// So the drag sets a display order and nothing else, which is the same kind of
// thing naming a workspace already is: the dock has shown a workspace's name
// rather than its number since names existed, so what the pill says and what the
// key presses have been separate for as long as there has been anything to say.
// The order is one more choice of that kind, and it is held to the rule the name
// is: it is daemon-owned and session-scoped, so every client attached to a
// session sees the one arrangement, and it is applied at exactly one place, so
// no two surfaces can disagree about it.
//
// That one place is workspaceDisplayOrder. The dock strip, the workspace
// switcher and the rail's terminals section all arrange through it, which is
// what stops a reorder from being visible in the dock and invisible everywhere
// else. Nothing that addresses a workspace goes near it.

// dockWorkspaceDragState is the click-or-drag gesture on a dock workspace pill,
// modelled on the rail's session reorder because it is the same gesture: a left
// press arms it, motion onto another pill turns it into a drag whose draft Order
// the strip draws live, and the release either commits the draft or performs the
// plain switch the press deferred.
//
// The press cannot switch on its own the way it used to. A switch retiles the
// panes and moves the pills, so a drag that began with one would be dragging a
// pill that had already left under the pointer.
