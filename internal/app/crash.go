// What dartuios does when it reaches a state it should not have reached.
//
// The panic barriers came first and the report came second, which is the wrong
// way round and is why this file exists. Update and the graphics flush have
// recovered per-event panics for a while: the pane survives, a line goes into
// the in-app log, and a file lands in the state directory. None of that reaches
// the person at the keyboard. LogError draws nothing (see os_notify.go: the log
// ring is only visible behind leader D l), so the whole of what a user saw when
// dartuios hit an impossible state was one frame that did not update. A bug nobody
// can see is a bug nobody reports.
//
// A CrashReport is the snapshot the overlay draws and the clipboard carries. It
// is built once, at the moment of the panic, and it is a plain value from then
// on: no pointers back into the model, no methods that read live state. That is
// deliberate and it is the whole design. The overlay renders after something
// has already gone wrong, so anything it reads could be the thing that broke.
// Copying the facts out once, behind its own recover, is what lets the drawing
// code be ordinary.
//
// What the report may carry is the second rule, and it is a privacy rule. See
// crashFacts.

// CrashReport is one panic and the facts that place it.
//
// Every field is a string or an int filled in at capture time. Rendering,
// copying and building an issue URL are all pure functions of this struct, so
// they can be tested against a report that no model ever produced, which is the
// only way to test the case that matters.

// that says who someone works for, and none of them has ever helped place a
// panic in a stack trace.

// says nothing at all. It goes in.
//
// This runs from inside a recover, on a model that has just failed, so it
