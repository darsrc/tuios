// The rail's layout is an ordered list with a number on each entry, which is
// the one shape a settings row cannot hold. It was a text field until now:
// "sessions:25,terminals,files:25,agents:34", typed by hand, with a colon that
// means one thing and a comma that means another, and no way to see what you
// had done until you closed the panel.
//
// So it is an editor, built the way the dock's is, because a person who has
// moved a clock onto the left of the dock should not have to learn a second set
// of habits to move the files list up the rail. Same keys, same two lists, same
// applied-as-you-go saving.
//
// # Membership lives here and nowhere else
//
// There used to be two ways to take a section off the rail: leave it out of the
// layout, or set the boolean named after it. The layout won, and the spacer is
// why. A layout may carry two spacers, in two different places, and a boolean
// per section has nowhere to put the second one and no way to say which gap it
// means. So the list owns order, share and membership together, the booleans
// fold into it on load, and this editor is where a section is turned off.
