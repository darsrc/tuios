	// mode supplies the ssh.Session so graphics bytes flow through the same
	// pipe as bubbletea's text output and reach the client's terminal.
	GraphicsOutput io.Writer

	// GraphicsRemoteClient marks the graphics host as a network client (SSH)
	// that does not share the server's filesystem, so file-medium kitty
