// fastWindowBox draws a pane's frame around a body that is already exactly the
// pane's rectangle, without measuring the body, or reports false and leaves the
// job to lipgloss.
//
// A CPU profile of the client under a DOOM-fire flood put 50% of all samples in
// the one Style.Render this replaces, and on a pre-shaped body every pass it
// makes over the content is a no-op it pays full price for:
//
//   - the core-text loop styles each line with an empty style, which x/ansi
//     returns unchanged;
//   - alignTextVertical pads to a height the body already is;
//   - alignTextHorizontal measures every line twice, once to find the widest
//     and once in the loop, to pad lines that are already the widest;
//   - applyBorder measures a third time to size a bottom edge that addToBorder
//     then throws away, and walks that edge a column at a time asking each
//     glyph how wide it is;
//   - applyMargins measures a fourth time, at zero margin, to size a run of
//     spaces it never uses.
//
// What survives the no-ops is one border cell on each end of each row. That is
// what this writes, in one pass, with the two chrome rows the frame carries
// spliced in as it goes rather than a box built and then cut apart.
//
// The output is byte for byte what the lipgloss path produces.
// TestFastWindowBoxMatchesLipgloss is the proof, run over every Unicode case
// the pre-shaped path already carries plus a size matrix.
