// The whole client frame, including the half of it nothing in this repo could
// measure.
//
// Every benchmark in dartuios stops at the composed string. That leaves the step
// that turns the string into bytes on the wire unmeasured, and the last full
// attribution put a quarter of the client's time there, so a quarter of the
// cost was being optimised blind.
//
// The gap was never that the step is untestable. bubbletea's renderer is
// unexported (cursedRenderer, cursed_renderer.go:18) and only reachable through
// tea.Program, but the renderer does not do the work: it delegates to
// ultraviolet's TerminalRenderer, which is exported, takes a plain io.Writer,
// and needs no terminal at all. frameSink below is that delegation, reproduced
// from cursedRenderer.flush (cursed_renderer.go:257) with the sequence it
// performs on an alt-screen frame, which is the only kind dartuios draws
// (render.go sets view.AltScreen unconditionally).
//
// What frameSink deliberately leaves out is the wrapper around the diff:
// alt-screen entry, cursor visibility, bracketed paste, synchronized output.
// Those are a fixed handful of bytes per frame and are unexported anyway. What
// it keeps is everything proportional to the frame: parsing the string into
// cells, diffing against the previous frame, and emitting the escape sequences
// for what changed.

// BenchmarkClientFrame is the whole client frame under a flood, split into the
// three parts it is actually made of, so the attribution comes out of the
// benchmark rather than out of a profile read over the top of it.
//
//   - "parse" is the guest's bytes going into the emulator, the VT half.
//   - "compose" is the emulator's cells coming out as a frame string, which is
//     what every other benchmark in this repo measures.
//   - "emit" is the diff against the last frame and the escape sequences it
//     writes, which is what none of them did.
//   - "whole" is all three back to back with no timer games, and is the number
//     that bounds the client's frame rate. It should be about the sum, and
//     saying so is the check that the three parts are the whole thing.
//
// The pane count is the axis that matters, and it is an axis nothing measured
// before: one pane is the fullscreen case the flood profile was taken in, two
// is the common split, nine is a grid the maintainer actually uses, and twenty
// is the question of whether any of this is per-pane or per-cell. The screen is
// the same size in all four, so a cost that tracks cells stays flat across them
// and a cost that tracks panes climbs.
//
// Every pane is repainted every frame, which is the worst case rather than the
// common one, and the emit half is where that shows most: a diff against a
// frame that changed everywhere has nothing to skip.
//
// Benchmark only, so it costs a normal CI test run nothing. Under -bench it is
// a few seconds per case at the default -benchtime.
