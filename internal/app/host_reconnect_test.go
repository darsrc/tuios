// The policy for getting a lost link back, pinned where it can be read.
//
// The behaviour these hold is the one the maintainer asked for: a link that
// drops is dialed again without him asking, the pane he was working in stays on
// screen while that happens, and a failure that trying again cannot fix stops
// at once with the reason rather than being retried until the budget runs out.

// TestTheBudgetOutlastsWhatItWaitsOn is the number that decides whether the
// client gives up too early.
//
// This client dials the host through the daemon on its own machine, and that
// daemon only answers once its own link is back. Under that sit two waits it
// does not control: the daemon's redial backoff, and ssh's keepalives, which
// take their own window to notice a dead path at all. A budget under their sum
// would give up while the machinery below it was still working.
