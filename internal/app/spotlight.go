// The spotlight is one pass over the composed canvas that turns the light down
// on every cell outside an ellipse. It is a presentation aid: a demo viewer
// looks where the light is, and the rest of the screen goes quiet without going
// away.
//
// Four decisions are load-bearing, and each of them was a measurement.
//
// Where it runs. The pass mutates m.renderCanvas in composeFrame, after
// GetCanvas has consumed every pane's cached layer and before Render turns the
// canvas into a string. The canvas's CellAt hands back a pointer into the
// buffer, so the pass edits in place and no cache upstream is invalidated. That
// is what lets the beam move on every frame for the price of the pass alone.
// Doing it in the pane cell loop instead would put the beam position in each
// pane's content cache key, so every pane would re-render on every move: 1.67 ms
// all-dirty against 0.90 ms one-dirty, and worse with each pane added. This pass
// is flat in pane count.
//
// What it costs. About 0.3 ms on a nine-pane 207x55 frame, and no allocations
// at all once the blend cache is warm. The naive spelling (blendColors per
// cell, boxing the result) allocates about 16,000 times a frame, which is what
// would make the feature a permanent tax rather than a thing you switch on.
// Two lines are the whole difference: the grounds are held as pre-boxed
// color.Color values rather than assigned from a color.RGBA per cell, and every
// blend goes through a cache of 16 quantised levels.
//
// What it must not skip. A blank cell that carries a colour is dimmed like any
// other. Skipping them "because nothing is visible there" reads as the obvious
// optimisation and is the opposite: it splits every word run in half at the
// space, and the frame goes from 11 KB to 40 KB.
//
// A cell the guest left at the terminal default gets the theme's pair and is
// dimmed from there. That is most of a real screen (a shell prompt, ls output,
// a blank pane), and dartuios emits no colour for any of it, so a pass that left
// such a cell alone dimmed the syntax highlighting and nothing else. No unit
// fixture full of explicit SGR can see that; the e2es that read Cell.Fg and
// Cell.Bg off a real pane are what found both halves of it.
//
// What it carries a cell toward. Black, and not the theme's ground. The first
// version carried every colour toward the ground, which is the colour a pane's
// background already is, so at dim 95 a background came out a quarter darker
// and no more: the screen stayed lit however dark the text went. See
// spotlightDark.
//
// What it can turn down, and what it cannot. Every colour the pass can read
// channels off is scaled toward black by the dim setting. That is every
// truecolor cell and every 256-cube index from 16 up, whose RGB is a fixed
// standard mapping. Two things are not readable and each gets SGR 2 instead:
// one of the sixteen the host's own palette owns, and a cell that names no
// colour at all with no theme to stand in for it. See dimmable.
//
// A screen with a theme is therefore dimmed whole, and a screen with none comes
// back mixed: the coloured parts scale, the rest goes faint. Mixed is the
// honest answer. The alternative was to put the whole no-theme screen on SGR 2,
// which ignored the dim setting entirely, so 10 and 95 drew the same frame.
//
// It is client-local, like the showkeys overlay. Nothing crosses the wire and a
// peer attached to the same session sees its own screen unchanged. The screen
// saver suspends the pass, the crash overlay never reaches it (View draws that
// before composeFrame), and everything else in the canvas (popups, pickers,
// panels) dims with the rest, because they are composed before the pass runs.
