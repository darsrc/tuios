// One wiring for the daemon connection, shared by every client.
//
// The local attach client, the SSH server and dartuios-web each used to register
// the daemon client's callbacks themselves, three copies of the same list.
// When the session-ended and disconnect handlers were added the local client
// got them first and the two servers held their last frame for ever until a
// later fix caught them up. The list lives here now, once, and the callbacks
// deliver through the model's own channels, which Init listens on. A callback
// runs on the daemon read-loop goroutine, so nothing in here touches the model:
// every event is queued and applied in Update like any other message. The log
// lines cannot use the model's own ring for the same reason, and they cannot go
// to the standard logger unconditionally either: in a local client that logger
// is the terminal the TUI is drawing on, and one line per state sync wrote
// itself across the frame. They go out only when verbose logging is on, which
// is when the local client has already pointed the logger at a file.
//
// TestEveryDaemonHandlerIsWiredHere pins that no entry point registers one of
// these itself.

// WireDaemonClient registers this model as the listener for everything the
// daemon sends an attached client: routed verbs, state syncs, peers joining and
// leaving, the session's size, the session ending and the connection going.
