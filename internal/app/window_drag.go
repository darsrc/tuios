// LiveWindowDrag reports the pane a window-move gesture is holding, or nil.
//
// A title-bar drag and a committed ctrl-drag both set Dragging and point
// DraggedWindowIndex at the pane, but so does a text selection, which rides
// the same flags with a pane in copy mode. What tells them apart is the mark
// beginWindowDrag puts on the pane and a selection never does: only a pane
// under the pointer's manipulation is being moved. A resize sets the same mark,
// so Resizing rules it out first.
//
// While this is non-nil the pane's rectangle belongs to the pointer. A layout
// pass leaves the rectangle alone and records the slot it would have used (see
// noteDragSlot), a state sync declines the rectangle the daemon holds for it,
// and the staleness checks read the slot in its place. Without those a peer's
// sync landing mid-drag put the pane back in its slot, and because the sync
// also carries the peer's focus, the motion that followed moved whichever pane
// the peer had focused instead: the drag ended with that pane parked at the
// pointer, overlapping the tiles.

// used the slot from the press would leave the pane at a rectangle the layout
// no longer has.

// The pane itself is left where the pointer has it. Placing it would also
// start a snap toward the slot, and a snap stamps its own rectangle over the
