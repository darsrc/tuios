// The file section for a pane whose process is on another machine.
//
// The section needs a directory before it asks for a listing, and a remote
// pane has none of the usual sources: no process here to read, and a shell
// that never announces over OSC 7 says nothing. The daemon that owns the
// window asks the machine running the process and puts the answer in the
// window state, so the client's whole job is to take it.

// TestMovingBetweenTwoMachinesAtTheSamePathAsksAgain.
//
// The section only asks for a listing when the answer would be different, and
// it decided that by comparing the directory alone. Two machines are very
// often in the same directory, because /home/ubuntu is /home/ubuntu
// everywhere, so moving focus from a pane on one machine to a pane on another
// left the first machine's files on screen with nothing saying so.
//
// Negative control: comparing only the directory in FilesSyncCmd returns no
// command for the second pane and this fails.
