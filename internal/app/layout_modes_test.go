// of the matrix where all three happened to agree.
//
// The contract: every pane's rectangle is inside the region, no two of them
// overlap, and the cells between two neighbours are exactly the ones the
// settings asked for: the divider's column when the panes gave up their
// borders, appearance.gap of empty ground when they did not.

// modeOS builds a tiled session of n panes at a given size, under the given
// pane-geometry settings, arranged by the named mode.
//
// The BSP tree is built first whatever the mode, because that is what happens
// in the app: BSP is the default, so a session that ends up in another mode has
// been through it, and the tree it left behind outlives the switch.
