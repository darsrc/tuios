// # File actions on the rail
//
// Six of them: create, rename, delete, copy, cut and paste. It is the set the
// maintainer named and no more. There is no multi-select, no tree, no filter
// and no drag and drop, because a twenty-six column rail beside a terminal is
// not the place to grow a file manager and yeetui already is one.
//
// # Where the prompts live
//
// Not in the rail. A create prompt, a rename field and a delete confirmation
// each have to show a name and a question, and the rail has about twenty-two
// columns left after its gutter and its glyph. "Delete /home/g/dev/dartuios/in…?"
// with the answer off the bottom is not a confirmation, it is a shape that
// looks like one.
//
// So they are centred dialogs, which is what this codebase already does for
// every focused question: the rename editor is one, the close-session
// confirmation is one, and both are drawn by the same overlay.Dialog. A user
// who has renamed a pane has already used this dialog. See
// render_file_prompt.go for the frames.
//
// # Nothing touches the disk on the update goroutine
//
// Every one of the six runs inside a tea.Cmd. This file decides what to do and
// writes down what was asked for; the command does it. A paste of a large tree
// takes as long as the disk takes and the rail keeps drawing for all of it.
//
// When an operation finishes it does not edit the listing in memory. It asks
// for the listing again through requestFileList, which stamps a generation and
// drops a superseded reply. Editing the slice instead would mean a read already
// in flight, from before the delete, could land afterwards and put the deleted
// name back on the rail.

// fileSpoofRefusal is what the rail says when a pane named a folder the kernel
// says its shell is not in. It is one sentence for what happened and one for
// what to do instead, because a refusal the user cannot act on is a dead end.
//

// and naming it would explain the mechanism instead of the situation.
