// The dock's refresh engine.
//
// The property this file exists to hold is one line long: a dock with no
// interval component arms no timer. Not a cheap timer, none. The scheduler
// below parks on a channel receive when nothing is due, so a default session
// pays for the dock exactly what it paid before there was a dock engine, and
// BenchmarkIdleTick stays where it is.
//
// What replaced what: the bar used to be redrawn sixty times a second whenever
// the clock or either meter was on, because NeedsDockTick pinned the maintenance
// tick to the normal frame rate and marked every one of those frames as needing
// a render. A clock that shows seconds needs one frame per second and the meters
// need one per two seconds, so that was between 60x and 120x more drawing than
// the feature asked for. Here each of them is a component with a deadline, the
// engine wakes for the earliest one, and a value that has not moved draws
// nothing at all.
//
// Custom components are subprocesses, which is the whole of the extension
// contract: environment in, one line of text out. Everything about them that is
// careful is in this file, because a dock cell that hangs the render loop would
// be a catastrophe. They run off the Bubble Tea goroutine, under a timeout,
// reading a bounded amount of output, and a failure hides the cell rather than
// breaking the bar.
