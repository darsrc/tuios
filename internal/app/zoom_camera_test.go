// Zooming a pane to part of the screen is a camera move over the layout, not a
// resize of the one pane.
//
// The layout is laid out in a box larger than the screen and the screen is
// panned to the pane you zoomed. Every pane keeps its place and its proportions
// relative to every other; the zoomed one is the one the camera is on, and its
// neighbours run off the edges because the box is bigger than the window you
// are looking through.
//
// These drive the tilers rather than the transform, because the transform is
// half the answer: the other half is that the layout is computed again at the
// camera's size, and only a test that goes through the tiler can see it.

// column a shared border is drawn in. At any zoom past about 1.5x that column
// became two, which drew fat dividers under BSP and none at all under
// master-stack, whose divider finder looks for neighbours exactly one gap
// apart. The layout is computed in the larger box instead, so every gap is the

// TestEverySideWithANeighbourPeeks is the report: zooming the middle pane of a

// It was not a rounding slip. A percentage buys very different numbers of cells
// on the two axes, because a screen is far wider in columns than it is tall in
// rows: at 95 percent of a 160 by 42 region the leftover is eight columns and
// two rows, so the sides showed four columns each and the top and bottom showed
// one row each. One row is the neighbour's border and nothing else, which reads
// as a line the layout forgot to remove.
// Master-stack with nine panes is a three by three grid, so its middle pane has
// a neighbour on all four sides. That is the arrangement the report is about
// and the only one where all four can be checked at once: the BSP spiral does
// not make a grid, and its middle pane genuinely has no neighbour on some
