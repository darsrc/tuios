// The crash overlay: the screen dartuios shows when it reaches a state it should
// not have reached.
//
// It is not one of the pickers, and the difference is the point. Every other
// overlay is drawn by renderOverlays, inside composeFrame, out of the model's
// live state. This one is drawn by View before composeFrame is called at all,
// from a snapshot that was taken before anything was drawn. That is what makes
// it safe to show after the compositor itself has panicked: if it went through
// the normal path it would re-enter the code that just failed, panic again, and
// leave the user with the same blank frame it exists to replace.
//
// The same reasoning puts its keys at the top of handleMsg rather than in
// internal/input. The input package walks the sidebar, the focused window, the
// keybind registry and a dozen Show* flags to decide who owns a key. All of
// that is model state, and the model is what is in question. Three keys, read
// before any of it, cost nothing and cannot be taken away by whatever broke.

// maxRecentActions is how many keybind actions the crash report remembers.
//
// Five is what fits on one line of the report and is about as far back as a
// user can confirm from memory. It is a ring on the model, not a log: it holds
// action names only, never keystrokes and never text, so it costs one string
// store per action and carries nothing private. See crashRecentActions.
