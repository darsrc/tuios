// The glyph picker is the theme picker's opposite number. A theme is a name
// from an open set and so is a glyph set, so both are searched rather than
// cycled, and both preview live: the theme picker shows you the colour, this
// shows you the shape.
//
// What it shows that a cycler could not is the difference between what a set
// says and what draws. A set states only the roles it changes, and a role whose
// glyph is the wrong width for its slot is dropped back to the default with
// nothing on screen to say so, because the alternative is a window control the
// pointer no longer lands on. list-glyphs answers that in two columns for an
// agent; the same answer belongs on screen.

// glyphSample is one set's preview: the glyphs a row draws, and what the set
// asked for that did not survive.
