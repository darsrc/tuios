// The panel builds their rows from this, the picker is opened against it, and
// applying a colour comes back through it. Before, the two border colours were
// text fields with their own inline getters and setters and the tint was an
// enum whose literal form the panel could not reach at all; three descriptions
// of three settings that differ only in which field they hold.
//
// Which options belong here is not decided here: the registry marks the ones
// that hold a colour, and TestEveryColourOptionGetsThePicker walks the registry
// against this list, so an option marked later cannot quietly stay a text
// field.
