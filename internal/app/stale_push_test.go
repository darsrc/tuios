// A client does not open or close a pane. It asks the daemon to, and the daemon
// says what it did. Between the question and the answer the client does not know
// the session's window set, and that is the whole of these two tests: the
// keystroke that asks pushes state afterwards the way every keystroke does, and
// that push carries the window set as it was.
//
// The daemon reconciles such a push as stale and keeps the rectangles in it,
// because rectangles are the pushing client's to report. Here they are a layout
// for a window set that no longer exists, and it becomes canonical and is
// broadcast to everyone. Nothing downstream catches it: the check that asks
// whether a tiled layout is stale measures the box the panes span, and the panes
// of the older set span it exactly.

// that was split out of it.
