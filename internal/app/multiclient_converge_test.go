// A convergence harness for N clients on one session.
//
// The four multi-client geometry bugs of this week (8de5a589, 846b7d28,
// b71def75, a5d974ed) were one fault repeated: a piece of layout authority
// still lived in the client, so two clients held two opinions about one
// rectangle. Each was found by hand, reproduced by hand, and pinned by a test
// written for that one shape. This runs the class instead of the instances: N
// headless clients attach at sizes they chose themselves, a seeded random
// sequence of ordinary actions is played into them one at a time, and after
// every action the fleet has to converge.
//
// # What converged means here
//
// Two halves, because there are two authorities and they own different things.
//
// Client against client, exactly equal: every pane's rectangle (x, y, width,
// height), every pane's guest grid (the cells its shell is given), its
// workspace, its z, its minimized and floating flags; which pane is focused;
// the current workspace; the tiling flag, the layout mode and the master ratio;
// the pane-geometry arithmetic (shared borders, pane gap); and the negotiated
// box (the session's effective size and its chrome reserve).
//
// Client against daemon: the set of panes and their workspace, minimized and
// floating flags; which pane is focused; and, the one that matters most, the
// size the daemon is actually running each pane's shell at has to be the guest
// grid every client draws it in. A PTY has exactly one size, so this is not a
// convention, it is arithmetic: if the clients disagree, one of them is lying
// to the person reading it.
//
// # Why not byte-equal frames
//
// Too strong, and wrong for a reason the design depends on. Clients attach at
// their own terminal sizes; the session's box is the minimum over them, so a
// larger client legitimately draws a blank band the smaller one does not have.
// Theme, colours, border style, glyphs, title position and dimming are
// per-client and meant to be (see pane_geometry.go). Input mode is per-viewer.
// A frame comparison would fail on every one of those and would have to be
// weakened until it asserted nothing.
//
// # Why not something weaker
//
// "The clients stopped talking to each other" is the obvious weaker predicate,
// and it is what the existing ping-pong test measures. It is not enough on its
// own: every divergence this harness found on the tree it was written against
// was a quiet one. The clients had nothing left to say and were sat on
// different arithmetic, which no amount of watching the traffic can see. Quiet
// is necessary and not sufficient, so this asserts the state and uses quiet
// only as the sampling condition.
//
// # What is deliberately not asserted
//
// The daemon's own copy of the pane rectangles. The daemon stores what the last
// client to sync pushed; a client that retiles because it disagreed with a
// peer's sync must not push the result (that is the applyingPeerSync guard, and
// removing it is what makes two clients argue forever), so the daemon can
// legitimately hold rectangles nobody is drawing. What the daemon does own is
// the PTY size, and that is asserted.
//
// The geometry of panes on a workspace nobody is showing. Tiling walks the
// current workspace, so nothing lays those panes out, and two clients that last
// showed that workspace at different moments hold different rectangles with
// nothing wrong. Their daemon-owned fields are still compared.
//
// # What it is measured to catch
//
// Reverting 846b7d28 (the pane geometry arithmetic back onto the config
// globals) fails all five sequences, naming the panes that two clients give
// the same rectangle and different guest grids. Reverting the reserve
// negotiation of 8de5a589 (paneReserve returning this client's own chrome
// instead of the session's agreed reserve) fails three of five, naming the
// pane two clients put at different x.
//
// Two of the four it was written for it does not catch, which is worth saying
// out loud. b71def75's third fault (a layout that does not reach the edges is
// adopted anyway) needs a stale layout to arrive with no size change beside it
// to force a retile, and no action here produces one: every route that leaves a
// cramped layout on the daemon also moves the session's box, and the resize
// that follows retiles everyone. a5d974ed (a broadcast that beats the handlers
// is dropped) is a race the commit itself measured at 2 in 200 under load;
// reverting it leaves forty sequences green here, because the fleet registers
// its handlers immediately after attaching and there is rarely anything in
// flight to lose.
//
// # When to sample
//
// Never on a fixed sleep. After each action the harness delivers queued
// broadcasts until the fleet satisfies the predicate above and the queue is
// empty, or until a generous deadline expires; on expiry it reports the
// predicate's own complaint. A converged fleet reaches the condition in
// milliseconds, so the deadline is never the timing knob. It only bounds a
// failure. A separate cap on deliveries catches the other failure mode, two
// clients trading rectangles without end, which no deadline can tell from slow.
//
// # Reproducibility
//
// Every sequence is a seed. The seed and the whole action journal are printed
// on failure, and DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_SEED replays one.
//
// What the seed fixes is the actions: which client acts, what it does, and the
// sizes and configs the fleet was built with. It does not fix the order the
// daemon's broadcasts come back in, because those travel over real sockets
// through real goroutines. A divergence that needed a particular interleaving
// replays as a probability rather than a certainty, so the failure says so and
// says to repeat the seed.

// Zooming is in the default action set, and used not to be. It was behind

// and the flag that said why was not, so a peer read the box as a layout
// computed for somebody else's screen, tiled it away and resized the shared
// shell, and the client that asked for the zoom was left drawing a guest grid
// the daemon was not running. WindowState.Zoomed is what closed that, and the
// switch went with it: the action guards the thing now.
//
// Opening and closing a pane push the state afterwards the way every other
// action does, and they used not to. They were behind DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_STALEPUSH
// for as long as a client pushed a snapshot it built before the mutation it had
// asked the daemon for: the push carried the window set as it was, lost the race
// to the daemon's own change and was reconciled as stale, and reconcileStale
// keeps the pushing client's rectangles, so a layout for the older window set
// became canonical and was broadcast to everyone. Nothing downstream could tell
// it from a current layout: tiledLayoutStale measures the box the panes span,
// and the panes of the smaller set span it exactly, so no client retiled and the
// pane that was to be split stayed at its full width. SyncStateToDaemon declines
// that snapshot now, and the switch went with it: the action guards the thing.

// DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_MODES makes the "another tiling layout" action cycle the three
// tiling modes. It is off for the same reason the two above were: this tree does
// not converge under it, and the three ways it does not are none of them about
// the action itself.
//
// Until this existed the action called NextLayout, which cycles saved layout
// templates rather than tiling modes. There are none under the test's own XDG
// tree, so every sequence ever run raised "No saved layouts" and stayed in BSP,
// while the journal said the layout had changed. The harness has therefore
// never seen master-stack or the scrolling strip.
//
// Turned on, three of the five default sequences fail, each naming a piece of
// layout authority still held by the client:
//
//   - the strip's column topology is not session state. A client that switches
//     to the scrolling layout builds its strip from its own window list, and a
//     peer that adopts the mode from the sync builds its own: two panes came
//     out stacked in one column on the client that made the switch (@24,2 and
//     @24,19) and side by side on the other two (@24,2 and @50,2), which the
//     failure names as the guest grid the stacked client keeps a border out of.
//     Reproduce with DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_MODES=1 DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_SEED=4354685564937353519.
//   - a pane opened in the scrolling layout is not placed by the strip on every
//     client: one held it at the box's corner while the others had it in a
//     column. Reproduce with
//     DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_MODES=1 DARTUIOS_CONVERGE_SEED=11400714819323706650.
//   - one pane alone on a workspace under master-stack with shared borders on:
//     one client hands its guest the whole rectangle and another deducts a
//     border, so the same rectangle carries two guest grids. Reproduce with
