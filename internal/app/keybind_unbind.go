// Unbinding from the overlay. Two verbs, because a user who wants a key gone
// means one of two different things:
//
//   - "dartuios should stop taking this key, the program in my pane wants it."
//     That is KeybindFreeKey: the key comes off every action in every scope,
//     because a key still claimed by one of them still never reaches the pane.
//   - "this action should not be on this key." That is KeybindUnbindSelected:
//     one key, one action, and the action keeps whatever other keys it had.
//
// Both are written to config.toml as an empty list on the actions that ran out
// of keys, which is what stops the default coming back at the next load. See
// config/keybind_unbind.go for the encoding.

// keybindApply reloads the registry from the edited config, rebuilds the
// report, and returns the command that writes the file.
//
// The reload happens before the write is even started, so the overlay is
// showing the consequence of the edit (a freed key, a new conflict, an action
// left unbound) rather than the state before it.
