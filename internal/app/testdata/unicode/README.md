# Unicode emoji data

`emoji-data.txt` is taken verbatim from the Unicode Character Database, Unicode
17.0.0. It is the input to `TestNoEmojiInSourceStrings` in
`internal/app/no_emoji_source_test.go`, which fails on any character with an
emoji property in a string or rune literal of dartuios's own Go source.

## Why it is checked in

The same reason as `internal/vt/testdata/unicode`: a test that downloads its
input fails when the network does, and a new Unicode version would silently
change what it asserts. An upgrade is a visible commit.
