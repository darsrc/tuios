// # Where a deleted file goes
//
// yeetui deletes with os.RemoveAll and nothing comes back. That is a fair
// bargain in a file manager somebody opened on purpose, with the whole screen
// and a cursor they have been steering. A rail is not that. It sits beside a
// terminal the whole time the terminal is being used, the cursor lands on it in
// passing, and a keystroke aimed at a pane can arrive here. So the default is
// the trash and permanent delete is the alternative you ask for.
//
// # Why the spec and not gio
//
// The freedesktop.org Trash specification is a directory layout and two text
// lines, and this implements it directly rather than running `gio trash`.
//
// gio is the desktop's own implementation and handles more cases than this
// does. It is also a process that has to be on the machine, and dartuios runs on
// machines where it is not: a container, a build box, the far end of an ssh
// session. A default that works on the maintainer's laptop and refuses on the
// server is not a default. Running it also means one spawn per delete and an
// exit status where an error should be, and it cannot be tested without
// installing it.
//
// The layout is the same either way, so a file this puts in the trash is the
// file the desktop's own trash shows, restorable from it by the usual means.
//
// # What it does not do
//
// One trash: the home one, under XDG_DATA_HOME. The spec also describes a
// per-volume trash for files on other filesystems, and this does not implement
// it. A file on another disk cannot be renamed into the home trash, so the
// delete refuses and says to use permanent delete instead, which is on a key of
// its own. Copying the file into the home trash instead was the other option
// and is worse: a delete that silently duplicates a large tree onto the home
// disk is not what anybody pressed.
//
// And there is no trash on Windows. The Recycle Bin is not this layout, and a
// folder called Trash under AppData that no Windows tool can restore from would
// be a promise this cannot keep. trashAvailable says so, and the confirmation
// there says the delete is permanent, because it is.

// trashDirFunc resolves the home trash directory. It is a variable so a test
// can point it at a temporary tree, which is the only way to exercise the real
// rename without putting anything in the user's own trash.
var trashDirFunc = homeTrashDir
