// Zoom is shared session state, and these are the two halves of what that has
// to mean with two people looking at one session.
//
// A pane's PTY has one size, and zooming resizes it: toggleZoom routes the
// zoomed rectangle through Window.Resize. So a client that does not know a pane
// is zoomed is not merely drawing a different picture, it is drawing a guest
// grid the shell is not running in. Worse, it counts the pane among the
// tiled ones, tiles it back and pushes that, which takes the zoom away from the
// person who asked for it.
//
// What travels is the flag. The rectangle does not: a zoomed pane covers the
// content region of whichever client zoomed it, and every client works its own
// out from the box the session agreed on, the same way it works out a tiled
// layout.

// twoClientsOnOneTiledSession brings up a tiled session with two full clients
// on it, each with its own connection, its own OS and its own chrome, and
// leaves the box settled and every pane's size agreed.
//
// The rails are on opposite edges on purpose. That is what makes the reserve
// negotiation load-bearing, and the zoom box is measured against the negotiated
// reserve rather than either client's own chrome, so a rail nobody shares is
// exactly the way a zoomed rectangle could come out different on the two sides.
