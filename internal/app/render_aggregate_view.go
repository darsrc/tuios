// The all-windows overlay is a jump-to-window picker, so it is drawn as one:
// the same search-and-list panel the command palette, the session switcher and
// the workspace switcher use, on the same grammar, with the same keys.
//
// It used to be a bespoke two-pane layout sized to fixed fractions of the
// screen, four fifths wide by three quarters tall whatever it held. A session
// with one window got a modal covering most of the terminal and almost entirely
// empty, and the right-hand pane showed the selected pane's raw output with no
// framing, which on a pane full of compiler diagnostics read as a wall of noise
// beside the list rather than as information about it. It also returned no hit
// rows, so the one overlay whose whole purpose is picking something could not be
// clicked.
//
// The preview is gone rather than fixed. The question this overlay answers is
// "which of my windows do I want", and the last few lines of a pane's scrollback
// answer it far worse than the pane's name, where it is, what it is doing and
// what directory it is in, all of which fit on the row itself. Dropping it also
// stops the list rebuilding a preview string for every window, under the pane's
// IO lock, on every keystroke.
