// Motion is the decorative animation the frame carries on top of what it
// shows: an overlay fading in as it opens, and the shimmer on a working
// agent's row. Both are appearance.motion = full only. The clock also carries
// the copy sweep (copy_flash.go), which runs at basic and full.
//
// It has its own clock rather than riding the maintenance tick. The tick runs
// at the frame rate whenever anything periodic is live and falls to ten a
// second otherwise, and it does a round of work per wakeup (window sweeps,
// alert flushes, animation steps) that a shimmer frame has no use for. The
// motion clock is a single timer that exists only while something is moving:
// Update arms it when a fade starts or a working row is on screen, each frame
// it delivers either re-arms it or lets it lapse, and a screen with nothing
// moving has no motion timer at all. That is what keeps the idle cost where
// TestIdleCostStaysLow holds it.
//
// Its frames go through the ordinary render path. The fade and the shimmer are
// passes over the composed canvas (see composeLayers), so a frame drawn for
// them re-renders no pane and rebuilds no rail: every cached layer is copied in
// as it is on any frame, and the pass edits the few cells that move.

// peer on the same session animates its own screen.
