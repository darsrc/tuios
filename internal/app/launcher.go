// The launcher is its own overlay rather than a tier inside the command
// palette, because the two lists answer different questions.
//
// A palette row is a verb dartuios performs: Split Vertical, Toggle Zoom, Switch
// Session. A launcher row is a thing you start. Ranking them against each other
// means one query straddles both ideas, and the palette had to carry a constant
// (paletteRunPenalty) whose whole job was to stop "new" from offering newgrp
// above New Window. That constant was the tell: two lists that need a handicap
// to share a box are two lists.
//
// The split also buys the rows things the palette could not give them. Every
// program carried the same "[Run]" tag, which said nothing; the count in the
// footer said "N of M commands" about a few thousand executables; and a program
// wants a second verb (type it out, below) that no command row has any use for.
//
// The palette keeps one row that opens this overlay, so nothing is lost for a
// user who only remembers one box.

// LauncherItem is one row: a program, and where the live query matched its
// name.
