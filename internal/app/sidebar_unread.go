// The unread bit on a finished pane, herdr's best idea: "done" means the agent
// stopped AND you have not looked yet. Without it a done row is permanent green
// noise, identical whether it was reviewed an hour ago or never seen at all.
//
// The bit is derived from two events and nothing else: focusing a done pane
// sets it, and any state change out of done drops it, so the next time that
// pane finishes it is unread again. There is no daemon protocol for it because
// "has this human looked at it" is per client, not per session.
//
// done only comes from an explicit report, so the daemon also counts finished
// turns: every working-to-rest transition bumps a pane's CompletionSeq (see
// session/agent_turns.go). This client remembers the count each pane had when
// its user last focused it, and a pane at rest (idle or unknown) whose count
// has moved past that is drawn exactly as an unread done pane is. Looking at it
// records the new count, and the pane goes back to its own state on the rail.
