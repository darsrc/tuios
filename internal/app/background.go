// The backgrounds: appearance.background and one option per surface.
//
// A cell left on the default background carries no colour, and that is
// deliberate: the host terminal draws its own background through it, so dartuios
// looks like the terminal it runs in. The options paint a ground there
// instead, either the theme's background or a colour of the user's, one
// surface at a time:
//
//   - the pane: the rectangle a pane's program draws in, together with the
//     marks drawn on it (the thin scrollbar) and the scrollback browser, which
//     shows a pane's own output;
//   - the desktop: every cell no layer covers, which is the gap between tiled
//     panes, the space around floating ones and an empty workspace, and every
//     floating layer with no ground of its own (the welcome splash, the gaps
//     in the keycast, the screen saver);
//   - the window chrome: the rest of a pane's layer, which is its border and
//     title bar, plus the lines between shared-border panes and the capture
//     marquee that is drawn over a pane's edge;
//   - the dock, and the rail.
//
// The overlay panels (the palette, settings, which-key, the Inbox, every
// picker, the badges and tooltips) are not on the list because they have no
// cell to paint: each fills its whole rectangle with its own surface colour.
// A panel that grew a transparent cell would take the desktop's ground, which
// is the one every layer without a surface of its own falls back to.
//
// It is all painted in the compositor, on the cells each layer parses to, and
// not in the code that draws each surface. Every way a pane reaches the screen
// goes through that one parse: the unfocused fast path that hands back the
// emulator's own Render(), the per-cell path, the cached content string,
// scrollback and copy mode, the zoomed pane, floating panes and popups,
// whichever VT backend the binary was built with, and the SSH and browser
// clients, which draw the same composed frame. The chrome is the same story
// told by several files, and one pass over the parsed cells is one place to
// keep right. The desktop is not a layer at all: it is the value the canvas is
// cleared to before the layers land.
//
// A cell with a background of its own keeps it: a program's colours, every
// mark dartuios paints over a pane (the selection, search matches, the copy mode
// cursor), a border's accent, a dock pill. Only the empty ground changes. Text
// left in the default colour on a painted cell takes the theme's foreground,
// lifted to read on a colour of the user's, so it stays legible; text that
// names its own colour keeps it.
//
// The paint is kept with the parsed cells, so a layer that did not change
// since the last frame is copied as before and pays nothing. With every option
// off, the cost is the string comparisons that find them off.
//
// The one frame that is not composed is a lone pane filling the region, which
// the fullscreen fast path hands to the host as a string without parsing it.
// That path paints the same rule into its string instead: see
// background_fast.go.

// surface is one of the places a background can be set on its own.
