// What a window on top of an image leaves of it.
//
// A kitty image is not drawn by dartuios. The host terminal paints it over the
// finished frame, so a pane drawn on top of it does not cover it the way a pane
// covers text: the cells are composited and the image is not. Until now the
// answer was to hide any image a higher window touched at all, which is correct
// and blunt. One cell of overlap took the whole picture away, and dragging a
// window near an image made it blink out.
//
// It does not have to. A placement can be cropped, and the machinery to crop
// one already exists for the screen edge and the layout box: a source rectangle
// and a cell count. So the question is not "is this image covered" but "what
// rectangle of it is still clear", and the answer is one the existing crop can
// carry.
//
// One rectangle is the limit of what a placement can show. A window over the
// middle of an image leaves a ring, which is four rectangles, and a window over
// a corner leaves an L, which is two. Those are drawn as the largest rectangle
// that is clear, so part of the picture stays rather than none of it. An image
// placed by Unicode placeholders has no such limit, because there the cells are
// text and the compositor has already done the work; see the placeholder notes
// in kitty_placeholder.go.

// cellRect is a rectangle of screen cells.
