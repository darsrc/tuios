// Host terminal focus.

// The view asks the host terminal for focus events (DECSET 1004), and a
// terminal that supports them reports each time its window gains or loses
// focus. The client keeps the last report and passes every change to the
// daemon, which keeps one per attached client (session.sessionHostFocus).
//
// Until the terminal says anything the focus is unknown, and unknown is read as
// looking. A terminal without focus events therefore behaves exactly as dartuios
// did before the signal existed: every rule that asks "is the person looking"
// answers yes, as it always did.

// hostFocusState is the host terminal's focus as its last event reported it.
