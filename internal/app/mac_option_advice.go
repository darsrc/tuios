// composing characters out of Option chords instead of sending Alt.
//
// It fires on a chord dartuios recognised anyway, which is deliberate: that is the
// moment it can be certain of the diagnosis, having just had to translate a
// composed glyph back into the chord the user meant. The glyph tables cover the
// characters macOS composes, and nothing can cover a dead key the terminal
// swallows whole (Option+n emits nothing at all until a second key ends the
// composition) or the alt+arrow chords Ghostty rewrites before they are encoded.
// Those keep missing until the setting named here is turned on, so the user is
// told about it the first time the subject comes up rather than left to find out
// which of their bindings are quietly unreliable.

// alt+b and alt+f, the readline word motions, instead of as arrow keys.
//
// This is the case the advice was written for and the one it could never
// reach. NoteComposedOptionChord fires on a composed glyph, and these two
// arrive with a real Alt modifier and no glyph at all, so pressing Option+Left
// produced no hint, no action, and nothing to read. Ghostty rewrites them in
// its own shipped keybinds, before any encoding, so they miss even with
// macos-option-as-alt turned on; see GhosttyAltArrowAdvice.
