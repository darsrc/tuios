// The rail's worktree groups.
//
// A session whose directory is a linked git worktree is drawn under a row for
// its repository and labelled by its branch, rather than flat under its own
// name. Five sessions called dartuios-feat-one to dartuios-feat-five say nothing
// about each other in a flat list; under one "dartuios" row labelled by branch
// they say what they are, and the repository can be folded shut when the work
// in it is not what the user is looking at.
//
// Everything here runs in the render path from the cached listing alone. The
// daemon detects the worktree and puts the record on the listing; nothing in
// this file runs git, opens a connection, or arms a timer.

// sidebarWorktreeGoneTag is what a child row shows when its worktree directory
// has been removed. The session is still listed, because the shell in it still
// runs, and the tag is what says the directory under it does not.

//
// Only the sessions section reads it. The terminals and agents sections keep
