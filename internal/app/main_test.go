// It also seeds config.Global with the looks from before v0.8.0 (rail off,
// dock and titles at the bottom, full-screen zoom, single-click typing, thin
// scrollbar). Most fixtures in this package build their OS from the global
// and were measured against that screen: a dock row at the bottom, panes
// that fill the width. The v0.8.0 defaults are tested on their own, from
// config.DefaultSettings, in sidebar_defaults_test.go.
