// Icons are drawn as real pictures, not glyphs, and only where the host can

//
// The size is the whole design. A launcher row is one text line, so an icon
// gets one row of height and the two columns beside the marker, which is
// roughly twenty pixels square on an ordinary terminal. That is favicon scale,
// and at favicon scale a Firefox or an OBS mark is still recognisable while a
// single cell is mush. Two by one is therefore the budget, and the icon is
// fitted to it rather than the row being grown to fit the icon.
//
// Three things follow from drawing a picture in a cell grid. The escape
// sequence has to be written after the frame the cells were reserved in, or the
// frame paints over it: that is what flushLauncherIconsForFrame and the
// reserved blanks in launcherRow are for. Decoding and scaling are filesystem and CPU work, so
// they happen in a tea.Cmd and arrive as a message, never on the Update
// goroutine. And nothing about any of it may run on a timer, so a decode is
// asked for once per icon and the result is kept for the life of the process.
//
// When the host cannot draw an image there is no icon column at all. A column
// of identical placeholder glyphs is worse than the list this replaced, and the
// point of the column is the picture.
