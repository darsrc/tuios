// runs inside bubbletea's frame loop, outside Update's recover, so it takes the
// process down and every pane with it.
//
// The pane is left floating above the top edge because that is the arrangement
// the fuzzer shrank to: tiling off keeps a pane at the rectangle a taller host
// gave it, so the shrunk viewport leaves it starting off-screen.
