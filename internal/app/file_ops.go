// # The file operations
//
// sidebar_files.go said the section "does not create, rename, delete or move
// anything: yeetui does all of that far better than twenty-eight columns ever
// will". It does the basics now, and the paragraph is wrong in one direction
// only: yeetui is still the file manager, and this is still a rail. What moved
// across is the set the maintainer named, in his own words and with his own
// rules, so a person who knows one knows the other.
//
// The functions here are yeetui's, ported: createPath, renameEntry, copyTree,
// pastePaths and uniqueLocalDst keep their names, their collision rules and
// their refusals. Two things differ, and both are about where the rail sits.
//
// A delete goes to the trash. yeetui removes with os.RemoveAll, which is
// defensible in a file manager somebody opened on purpose; a rail is beside a
// terminal and is a more incidental place to put a keystroke. file_trash.go
// says how the trash works and what it costs.
//
// And nothing here runs on the update goroutine. Every one of these is called
// from inside a tea.Cmd, off the loop, for the reason at the top of
// sidebar_files.go: a copy of a large tree on the loop would freeze every pane
// in the client for as long as the copy took.
//
// # No shell, anywhere
//
// Not one of these builds a command line. A name off a filesystem can hold a
// space, a quote, a semicolon or a newline, and every one of those is inert
// here because it is an argument to a syscall and never a word in a sentence
// somebody else parses. sidebar_files.go's shellQuote exists for the one place
// that does type at a prompt, and no operation here goes near it.

// createPath makes the file or folder raw names, under cwd.
//
// A trailing slash means a folder; anything else is a regular file. A name with
// a separator in it nests, and the folders on the way are made, which is
// yeetui's rule and the reason the prompt says "trailing / for a folder"
// rather than offering two prompts.
//
// It never overwrites. An existing target is an error, not a replacement.
