// The colour picker pointed at a settings row.
//
// It is the picker the rail already uses, given a third kind of target rather
// than a second dialog: a user who has coloured a pane knows how to colour a
// border, and one overlay with three targets is one set of key bindings, one
// set of hit rects and one contrast story.
//
// A colour option has three states, not two, and the third is the reason a text
// field was the wrong control for it. It can hold a colour; it can be unset, and
// then it shows whatever the theme or the default produces; and the scrollbar
// tint can hold a keyword, which is neither. The picker says which of the three
// is in force in the readout, and reaches all three: the grid, the slots, the
// hex field and the harmony chips set a colour, the named chips set a keyword,
// and the clear control unsets it.

// OpenColorSetting opens the picker on a colour-valued option, seeded with the
// colour that option is producing right now.
//
// Seeding from the effective colour is what makes "change this colour" start
// from the colour being changed, and it does not pin the option to it: nothing
// is written unless the user picks something, and applying the seed unchanged
// writes nothing at all.
