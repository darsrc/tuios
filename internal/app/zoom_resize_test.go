// TestToggleZoomResizesDaemonTerminal is the regression for TASK 3: zoom moved
// the window box but resized only the local emulator and PTY, so a daemon-hosted
// pane (Pty == nil, resized through DaemonResizeFunc) kept its old size and the
// app never reflowed. Both zoom-in and zoom-out must push the new size to the
// daemon.
//
// Run with the zoom slide off and on. With it off the pane is put in the box and
// the guest is told in the same breath. With it on the snap walks it there and
// the guest is told once at the destination, which is the bargain every other
// pane movement makes: telling it up front would reflow the app to a size the
// pane does not have yet and draw it wrong for the length of the slide. Either
// way the guest ends up at the size the pane ended up at, which is the promise
// this test is here for.
