// told (the PTY winsize, captured from DaemonResizeFunc and mirrored by
// AnnouncedSize) must equal the emulator's own grid and the drawable box the
// renderer clips to (ContentWidth/ContentHeight). A guest told one more column
// than it can draw in wraps its prompt; told one less, it letterboxes. The
// invariant is checked across every bordered/borderless, sidebar, and zoom
// combination, and again after each layout transition.

// toldSize is the last size the fake daemon PTY was told, standing in for the
// real PTY's winsize.
