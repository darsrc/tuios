// ProgramOptions is the one list of Bubble Tea options a dartuios client runs
// with. Every entry point spreads it into tea.NewProgram: the local client,
// the attach client, tape playback, the SSH server and dartuios-web.
//
// It exists because the list used to be typed out at five sites, and an
// option added to one was silently missing from the others. The motion filter
// below shipped on the local client only, so a served client composed a full
// frame for every pointer move, which is where a frame costs most.
//
// What is in here is what is true of every client regardless of transport:
//
//   - The frame rate cap. One number for every client.
//   - No signal handler. Every dartuios process already owns its signals: the
//     local commands install a handler that sends QuitMsg, and the servers
//     cancel a context that quits each session. A second handler per program
//     is at best redundant, and in a server it is one per connection.
//   - The motion filter, which is decided by the model's state and not by how
//     the bytes arrive.
//
// What is not in here is what differs by transport, and only that: the output
// writer, which the local client wraps and the servers serialize, and the
// input, environment and window size a server takes from its session. A
// transport supplies those itself, and it appends this list AFTER them. The
// order matters for one option: WithFilter is a single slot, both wish and sip
// install a filter of their own, and the last one wins. The filter here does
// what theirs did (see FilterMouseMotion), so it has to be the last one set.

		// (which bubbletea itself caps at 120) an idle dartuios woke 590 times a
		// second and spent 1.0% of a core doing nothing; at the default 60 it
