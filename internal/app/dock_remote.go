// A routed command's way into a client that is not the local attach client.
//
// The local attach path holds the tea.Program and can Send straight into it
// (cmd/dartuios/session_commands.go). The SSH server and dartuios-web hold the model
// but hand the program to a per-connection goroutine, so they push through a
// channel the way every other cross-goroutine source in this package does.
//
// Without this, a verb the daemon routes to the attached TUI reaches a local
// client and nobody else: set-option, send-keys and now refresh-dock all timed
// out against a browser or SSH session while findTUIClient still reported one
// attached. Web and SSH are first-class, so the channel is not dock-specific
// even though the dock verbs are what found it missing.

// remoteCommandQueue is how many routed commands may wait. A routed verb blocks
// its caller for ten seconds, so a backlog deeper than this is a caller that has
// already given up.
