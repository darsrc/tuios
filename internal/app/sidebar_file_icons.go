// The files section's icons.
//
// Three layers, and which of them draws is the whole of "it degrades".
//
// Underneath are three roles of the glyph set: folder, parent and file. They
// are settable like every other mark on the rail, they have ASCII spellings, and
// they are what a terminal running --ascii-only or a set that is 7-bit
// throughout draws. A listing is legible with nothing but those three.
//
// On top of that is one nerd font codepoint per file type, from the private use
// area. It is off in ASCII mode and off when appearance.sidebar.file_icons is
// false, because a terminal without a patched font draws every one of them as a
// tofu box. printableTitle strips exactly these codepoints out of window titles
// for that reason; the difference is that a title's icon is whatever a foreign
// program put there, while these are ours and the user has said their font has
// them.
//
// On top of that again is the colour, under appearance.sidebar.file_icon_colors.
// It needs the codepoint underneath it, so it is off whenever the icons are:
// an ASCII slash in ruby red is a colour with no shape to carry it. Off, the
// mark is drawn in the row's own ink like every other glyph on the rail.
//
// # Why the colour is worth arguing about
//
// The rail's design note spends emphasis on two things and no more: "this is
// where you are" and "this wants a human". A column of per-type colour is a
// third claim on the eye, and it stands in the files section directly under the
// agent-state glyphs, which are the alarm. That is the cost, it is real, and it
// is why the colour is an option rather than the only way the section draws.
// The default is on because that is what was asked for; the frame with both
// sections showing is what the choice should be made on.
//
// # Where the table went
//
// The glyphs and the colours both come from go-devicons, which is the generated
// Go form of nvim-web-devicons and the same table yeetui draws from, so the two
// programs name a file type the same way. It replaced a hand-written table of
// seventy extensions and eleven whole names. The trade is a dependency (MIT,
// 59 KB, no dependencies of its own) and a table nobody here can edit, against
// six hundred and fifty entries instead of eighty-one and a glyph that can
// never disagree with its colour.

// fileIcon is one file type's mark: the codepoint and the "#RRGGBB" the icon
// table gives it. A zero fileIcon means the type layer has nothing to say and
// the glyph set's own roles draw instead.
type fileIcon struct {
	Glyph string
	Hex   string

// fileIconParentGlyph is the ".." row's codepoint, and the one mark in the
// section the icon table has no opinion about: the parent is not a file type,
// it is the way out of the folder, so it wears a mark of its own and the user
// has something to aim at without reading. It takes a directory's colour,
// because a directory is what it is.
const fileIconParentGlyph = ""

// fileIconDir and fileIconAny are the table's own two generic answers: what a
// folder wears and what a name it has never heard of wears. Resolved once, by
// asking for a nameless entry of each kind, so the fallback is the library's
// rather than a codepoint copied out of it and left to drift.

// dirEntryInfo is a zero-syscall os.FileInfo built from what a directory read
// already returned.
//
// It exists because the only lookup go-devicons exports that does not touch the
// disk takes an os.FileInfo, and the one that takes a path lstats it. A listing
// of a large tree is read for the rail on every cd, and a stat per name in it is
// the cost this section was built to avoid: fileEntry keeps DirEntry.Type() for
// exactly that reason, and pays for it by reading a symlink to a directory as a
