// The component timeout, tested against the thing that actually breaks it.
//
// A bare `sleep 30` is one simple command, and a shell execs a lone final
// command instead of forking it. That case passes with no kill of the process
// group at all, so on its own it is a false green.
// Every command below forks a child that inherits the stdout pipe, which is the
// shape reported in issue 141 and the shape almost every real component has.

// dockTimeoutSlack is how long after the deadline a component still counts as
// killed. Generous, because the assertion under test is seconds against tens of
// seconds, not milliseconds against milliseconds.
