// TestRestoreKeepsDaemonOwnedAgentFields is the reported bug: the pane you are
// looking at never appears in the rail's agents section. Agent state is
// daemon-owned and reaches the attached session only by being copied onto the
// live window; the restore path copied the layout fields and dropped the agent
// ones, so every pane of the session you are in came back with no agent state
// and the section that lists them was built from nothing.
//
// Foreign sessions were unaffected because the rail rebuilds those from the
// daemon's polled listing, which is why the section could show other people's
// agents and never your own.
