// supports. `dartuios ssh` runs the whole TUI on the remote host and renders
// through the ssh.Session, so a desktop notification raised by this process
// would pop on a machine nobody is sitting at. An escape sequence travels the
// pipe to whatever terminal is actually in front of the user. The cost is that
// it cannot be clicked; the dock message carries the click.

// and a terminal has to buffer whatever it is handed; no notification daemon
// shows more than a couple of lines anyway.
