// moves, and which one applies is about what the user did rather than about
// what happened.
//
// A focus the user did not ask for, such as a workspace switch restoring its
// own focus, gets the least-scroll rule: a column already on screen does not
// move the strip under them. A key that says "take me to the next pane" is the
// other kind, and it was going through the least-scroll rule too, so cycling
// landed on panes still half off the edge.

// scrollingOS is a client in the scrolling layout with count panes, each wide
// enough that the strip is longer than the view.
