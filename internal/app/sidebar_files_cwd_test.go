// The directory a pane is in can come from two places, and they are not equal.
// The shell announces one over OSC 7, which the client parses out of the stream
// as it arrives. The daemon reports one in the window state, which it fills from
// the process it owns and which reaches the client on the next sync. These pin
// which wins, because getting it backwards broke a security check.

// TestAnAnnouncedDirectoryIsNotOverwrittenByTheDaemons.
//
// The client sees OSC 7 the moment it arrives; the daemon's copy lands on the
// next state sync. So adopting over the top puts a directory the pane has
// already left back on the window.
//
// That is not just stale. cwdIsSpoofed compares the folder a pane announced
// against the one the kernel reports for its shell, and a stale announcement
// disagrees with a current process for a pane that did nothing wrong, so every
// cd turned into a spoof warning and took the file actions with it.
//
// Negative control: dropping the w.Cwd == "" condition fails here with the
// stale directory.

// A security check is allowed to answer "no evidence". It is not allowed to
// answer using a fact from the wrong computer, which is what comparing a remote
// shell's directory against an unrelated local process does. The check is for
// panes this client's own daemon owns, and it runs only for those.
