// The rail is a map of what is open, and a map that scrolls the place you just
// went to off its own edge is a list you lose your place in. Focusing a pane
// far down the terminals section, or switching to a session below the fold,
// used to leave the row that now matters most out of sight: the agents section
// anchors its viewport to a row, and the cursor auto-scrolls while the rail has
// the keyboard, but nothing moved either of the other two sections on a focus
// change that came from a click, the palette, a hook or a key on the panes.
//
// The reveal is that missing move. It fires on a focus change only, never on
// every frame, because a reveal that fires on every frame fights the reader:
// they wheel the section away to look at something else and the rail wheels
// it straight back. So it remembers what the last frame was drawn for and acts
// only when the focused pane or the attached session is not what it was.
//
// It scrolls the least it can, the way the keyboard cursor does: a row below
// the fold lands on the last visible line, a row above it on the first. No
// centring and no easing. The rows are one line tall and the wheel jumps, so a
// scroll that slid over several frames would be motion in the corner of the
// eye on every pane switch, and the cursor auto-scroll that runs after it has
// to agree with it about what is on screen.
//
// A wheel or a drag between frames outranks the reveal, as it outranks the
// agents anchor: the reveal remembers the offset each section came to rest on
// and stands down when the offset is no longer that one, because a changed
// offset is the reader saying where to look now.

// sidebarRevealState is what the last frame was drawn for: the focused pane,
// the attached session, and the offsets the two sections settled on.
