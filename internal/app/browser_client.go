// What a browser tab cannot do, and what dartuios says about it.
//
// Everything in [appearance] renders as cells and reaches xterm.js intact, so
// the whole of it applies over the web. Two of the [notifications.agent] sinks
// do not, and both used to fail silently: an agent would finish, the config
// said to say so, and nothing said anything.
//
//   - notify writes OSC 9 in-band (see host_notify.go). sip's terminal
//     registers OSC handlers for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10-12, 52, 104, 110-112 and
//     1337, and none for 9, so the bytes are parsed and discarded. There is no
//     Notification API bridge in its frontend to route them to either.
//   - sound in "audio" mode shells out to paplay/aplay/afplay (internal/sound),
//     which plays on the machine running dartuios-web. That is the right machine
//     for a local attach and the wrong one for a phone across the room.
//
// Neither is worth silently rewriting the user's config over, so dartuios reports
// them through the config-warning channel that already exists for settings that
// will not do what they say, and skips the OSC 9 write that has nowhere to go.
// The sinks that do work are left alone: the dock message is drawn in the frame,
// and BEL reaches the browser, where sip flashes the terminal's outline.

// browserAlertWarnings names the alert sinks this session's config asks for and
// a browser cannot deliver. It returns nothing when the config asks for neither,
// so a user who never turned them on is not told about them.

// sshAlertWarnings is the SSH-served equivalent. OSC 9 does reach the client's

// remoteDockComponentWarning names where a custom dock component's command
// actually runs when the client is not on the user's own machine.
//
// A component is UI: it is composed in the client, so it runs wherever the
// client runs. For a local session that is the user's machine, which is what
// everyone expects. For dartuios-web the client is the server process, and for an
// SSH session it is the SSH host, so a component reading the git branch reports
// the server's checkout and one reading the battery reports the server's
// battery, which servers do not have.
//
// That is the correct behaviour and not a bug to route around: a component
// rendering into the bar has to run where the bar is composed, and the
// alternative is a protocol for executing commands on the viewer's machine,
// which is a much larger thing to own than a dock cell. What was wrong was
// leaving it to be discovered. Every attached client also runs its own copy,
// the way waybar runs one per monitor.
