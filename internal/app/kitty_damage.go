// A repainting guest hands us the same bitmap over and over with a little of
// it changed: a browser animating a canvas, a video player, a compositor in a
// pane. Forwarding each one in full is what made an animated page cost tens of
// megabytes a second on the wire, which saturates the host's pty, stalls every
// writer behind it, and starves keystrokes.
//
// Two things fix that, and both need the previous bitmap kept:
//
//   - An identical frame is not sent at all. A page that stops animating stops
//     costing anything.
//   - A frame that differs in part is sent as the parts that differ, patched
//     into the image already on the host with a=f frame edits. The placement
//     is left alone, so there is no delete and no re-place either.
//
// Damage is found on a grid rather than per pixel. A rectangle costs about
// sixty bytes of escape to describe and its pixels are measured in kilobytes,
// so the grid is fine enough that a small moving object does not drag half the
// frame along with it, and coarse enough that the diff itself stays a handful
// of memcmps per band.

	// the patch's colour; repeating a=f on the continuation loses the patch
