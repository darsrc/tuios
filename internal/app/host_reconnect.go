// Getting a lost link back.
//
// The premise of a session on another machine is that the daemon there owns it.
// The link is a pipe to it and nothing more, so a pipe that broke is not a
// session that ended: the shells are still running, the panes still have their
// scrollback, and the only thing that went is this client's way of seeing them.
//
// What used to happen was that the client gave up on the first end of the
// connection, closed every pane it was drawing, and put the user back in the
// session on their own machine. The far session survived, which was the design,
// and the person lost their place, which was not. This file is the other half:
// the client keeps the last frame on screen, dials again with a backoff, and
// puts the person back where they were.
//
// Three rules shape it.
//
// A failure that cannot be fixed by trying again is not tried again. A host
// that is not configured, a daemon that speaks a protocol this build cannot
// read, a session that is no longer there: all three fail at once, with the
// reason, because retrying them for three minutes teaches the user nothing and
// hides what is wrong.
//
// Leaving on purpose is not the same event as losing a link. A detach and a
// session switch both take the old connection down deliberately, and both
// unwire it first, so its closing is never heard here.
//
// A machine that is genuinely down is given up on. The budget below is the
// whole of it.

const (
	// hostReconnectFirstDelay is the wait before the first redial. It is short
	// because the common loss is a momentary one (a keepalive that lapsed, a
	// far daemon restarted), and the link is usually back on the first try.

	//
	// It is measured against the two waits that sit under it, not chosen for
	// how it reads. This client dials the host through the daemon on its own
	// machine, and that daemon only answers once its own link is back: its
	// redial backoff runs to a minute, and ssh's keepalives take another
	// forty-five seconds to notice a dead path in the first place. A budget
	// under two minutes would give up while the machinery below it was still
	// working. Three minutes clears both with room, and covers what actually
	// takes a host away for a minute or two: a network changing under a
