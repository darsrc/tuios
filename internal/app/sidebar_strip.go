// The collapsed rail is three columns and it is the state the rail spends most
// of its life in, so what it carries has to be worth those columns without a
// pointer. It carries the same lists the open rail does, in the same order:
// sessions, then the terminals of the session being shown, then the panes with
// something to say. Folding is a change of width, and a rail that dropped a
// whole list when it folded was a different object at each width, which is what
// made the folded one read as broken.
//
// The terminals list is the one that used to be missing. It was left out on the
// argument that the strip lists sessions across the daemon while terminals are
// a within-session list, so the two could not share a column. That argument was
// about grammar and the open rail already answers it: it stacks the same
// daemon-wide list over the same session-scoped one and tells them apart with a
// header. The strip now does the same thing with the same header, cut to the
// one column it has: "sessions" becomes s, "terminals" becomes t, "agents"
// becomes a, each with its section's own add control beside it. What was kept
// from the old reasoning is the rest of it: no digits outside the badge, one
// mark vocabulary across every list, and severity inked once.
//
// The void is gone because nothing is spread any more. The lists are one
// contiguous stack under the badge at a one-row interval, and the empty rail
// below them is a list that ended rather than a list with holes in it. The
// agents group used to be pinned to the bottom so the alarm held a screen
// position; the badge is what holds that position now, and it always did.
//
// A pane wanting a human is therefore said three times over, each in its own
// voice: the badge counts it and goes to the worst of them, the session
// carrying it swaps its resting dot for that state's glyph, and the pane itself
// carries the glyph in the terminals list when it is here and in the agents
// list wherever it is.
