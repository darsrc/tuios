// Two clients on one session in the scrolling (niri) layout, and what one of
// them doing something does to the other's view of the strip.
//
// The report these exist for: with a local client and a web client on one
// session, moving focus on either one redrew the focus border on the other and
// left its viewport where it was, so the focused window could be entirely off
// the peer's screen. The trace was that ApplyStateSync adopts the peer's focus
// and nothing else: EnsureFocusedVisible appears nowhere in it, and the strip's
// own idea of which column is focused was never moved either, so a client that
// took a peer's focus went on inserting new columns and stepping left and right
// from the column it last focused itself.
//
// The strip's offset is session state (SessionState.ScrollStrip): the strip is
// one long row of columns and the offset is a place on it, so two clients
// holding one offset are looking at the same place. That is safe because the
// panes' box is the same on every client (the session's size is the minimum
// over them and the chrome reserve the maximum), so one offset shows every
// client the same columns.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching the
// named assertion fail:
//
//   - ApplyStateSync not calling adoptScrollStrip:
//     TestPeerAdoptsADeliberateScroll fails saying A stayed at 0 while B is
//     at 60. The focus half of the same fault is e2e
//     TestScrollingPeerFollowsFocusIntoView.
//   - BuildSessionState not sending the strip: TestPeerAdoptsADeliberateScroll
//     fails.
//
// Three controls recorded here named unit tests that were removed in favour
// of e2e coverage (scroll_strip_workspace_test.go and
// scroll_peer_focus_test.go). They have not been rerun against those e2e
// tests, so read them as the faults to check for, not as measured results:
// RestoreFromState not taking the strip (a joining client lands at 65 while
// the session is at 45), tiledLayoutStale measuring the strip against the box
// again (a sync that only renamed a pane drags both clients back to 0), and
// scrollingLayoutStale never answering true (a pane left seven cells from
// where the strip puts it).
//   - adoptScrollStrip run against the workspace the sync arrived from rather
//     than the one it names: TestWorkspaceSwitchLandsBothClientsOnOneStrip
//     fails with the two clients on 65 and 45 after a round trip through
//     another workspace.
//   - ScrollingOnFocusChange calling ScrollToFocusedColumn again, and
//     EnsureFocusedVisible given the peek margin or never revealing, are
//     caught end to end by TestWorkspaceRoundTripKeepsTheScrolledStrip and
//     TestWorkspaceRoundTripRevealsAHiddenColumn in e2e/tui.
//
// StateFingerprint and reconcileStale are pinned in internal/session, where
// their own controls are recorded.
