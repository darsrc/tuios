// The rail's layout: which sections it stacks, in what order, and the share of
// it each one may claim.
//
// It used to be three sections in a fixed order with the split written into
// the rail's arithmetic. A fourth section made that untenable twice over:
// the order stopped being obvious (does a listing belong above the panes it is
// about, or below them?), and the split stopped being one anybody but the
// author would agree with. Both are now read off one string.
//
// # Why the rail now has a fourth section, having refused one
//
// The rail's old fixed split carried a written refusal to add a workspaces
// section, and three of its four reasons still stand. The fourth did not: it argued that
// three sections already cost ten lines of chrome before a row of content and
// that a fourth would take it to thirteen. That was arithmetic about floors
// nobody had made configurable. Shares and membership are now read off
// appearance.sidebar.sections, so a user who does not want a fourth section
// removes it, and a rail too short for what is left gives up lines rather than
// its region.
//
// The other three reasons are why the section that arrived is files and not
// workspaces. A workspaces section would restate what the terminals section's
// tags already say; it would be the second per-session list, competing with
// terminals for the same lines while saying less; and a workspace already has
// three surfaces that cost no rail lines at all. A listing restates nothing on
// screen, is not per-session, and has no other surface.
//
// # Shares are ceilings, not reservations
//
// This is the property that keeps a four-section rail usable. A share says how
// much of the rail a section may take, never how much it is given: a section
// with three rows takes three lines whatever its share says, and the rest goes
// to the flexible section. So the default's 25 + 25 + 34 does not leave the
// terminals list a sixth of the rail; it leaves it everything the other three
// have no rows for, which on a normal screen is most of it.
//
// A share is also not a floor. Lines nobody claimed go to whichever section
// still has rows below its own fold, so a listing of two hundred names fills a
// rail with room to spare rather than showing a quarter of it over thirty blank
// lines. A rail whose lists all fit keeps the gap it always had.
//
// # What gives way when the rail is too short
//
// The same ladder as before, generalised. A flexible section below its floor
// takes lines back from the sections with shares, the last in the layout first,
// none of them going below its own floor. If the floors still do not fit, lines
// are given up one at a time from the same end. A section is never given more
// lines than its rows can fill and the total is never more than the rail has,
// so two sections cannot land on the same line at any height.

// sidebarSectionPlan is one entry of the rail's layout.
