// # The files section
//
// One of the rail's stacked sections, beside sessions, terminals and agents,
// listing what is in the focused pane's directory. It used to be a mode that
// took the whole rail instead; it is a section now because "what is here" is a
// question the user keeps an eye on while working, not one they go into and
// come out of, and because a rail that hid its sessions to show a folder made
// the two mutually exclusive for no reason the user asked for.
//
// # Why the read is a command and not a call
//
// A mode could read the directory on the gesture that opened it, because there
// was exactly one such gesture and the user had just made it. A section is on
// screen the whole time and follows the focused pane, so the read now happens
// whenever a shell cds, whenever the focus moves, and whenever a client
// attaches. Doing that on the goroutine that runs Update is the bug this
// codebase has already shipped three times: a clipboard call that held the UI
// for thirty seconds, a screenshot stall, and a config write on the update
// path. A hung NFS or sshfs mount would freeze every pane in the client until
// the kernel gave up on it.
//
// So the read is a tea.Cmd. requestFileList stamps the request with a
// generation, the command does the open, the bounded read and the sort in its
// own goroutine, and fileListMsg carries the generation back. A reply whose
// generation is not the current one is dropped: a slow answer for a directory
// the user has already left cannot overwrite the one they are looking at, and
// the "loading" row stays up for the request that is actually outstanding.
//
// Nothing polls. The listing is read when the focused pane's directory stops
// matching the one on screen, and at no other time, so a client sitting on an
// open rail does no filesystem work at all. That is also the whole of what the
// section knows how to notice: a file written into the directory by something
// else does not appear until the listing is asked for again.
//
// # What it is not
//
// It is not a file manager. It lists, it walks in and out, it hands a path to
// the clipboard and a directory to a shell, and it does the six file actions
// named in sidebar_file_ops.go: create, rename, delete, copy, cut and paste.
// That is the whole set. There is no multi-select, no tree, no filter and no
// drag and drop, because yeetui does all of that far better than twenty-six
// columns ever will, and it runs in a pane.

// fileEntry is one row of a listing. Only what the rail draws and what a click
// needs is kept: the rest of an os.DirEntry costs a stat per file and answers
// questions twenty-eight columns cannot ask.

//
// # Why this is asked at all
//
// OSC 7 is a string any program in a pane can print, and the rail's delete,
// rename and paste act on the folder it names. A program that prints one naming
// a folder it is not in steers a destructive action at that folder. The pane's
// shell has a working directory the kernel knows, and that is the one fact in
// this the pane cannot write.
//
// # Only a positive disagreement counts
//
// The answer is false whenever there is no evidence. There is no /proc on
// macOS, a pane whose PTY has gone has no process to read, and a daemon older
// than WindowState.ShellPID sends no pid at all. Treating any of those as a
// disagreement would take the file actions away from users who did nothing
// wrong. Unknown is unknown, and it leaves the feature exactly as it was.
//
// Where the number comes from is the difference between a feature and a
// decoration. A pane this client spawned records its own shell at spawn time;
// a daemon-backed pane, which is every pane in the default deployment, is sent
// its shell's pid by the daemon that holds the process (see
// session.WindowState.ShellPID). Before the daemon sent it this check had
// nothing to compare against on any shipped pane and passed every spoof.
//
// # How the two paths are compared
//
// Not as strings, past the first try. /proc hands back a path the kernel has
// already resolved; a shell prints $PWD, which keeps whatever symlink the user
// walked in through. "/home/g/work" and "/mnt/big/work" are then the same
// folder spelled two ways, and a string compare would call every such pane a
// liar. So a mismatch is confirmed by stat'ing both and comparing the device
// and inode, which is the only comparison that answers "the same directory"
// rather than "the same spelling", and which takes symlinks, bind mounts and a
// ".." through a symlink together.
//
// A folder that cannot be stat'ed is a disagreement, because /proc has already
// named a directory that exists and this is not it.
//
// # What it costs to be wrong
//
// A false positive is a read-only listing: the names, the navigation and the
// path copy all still work, and only the six file actions go. A file manager
// running in a pane and reporting its own browsing over OSC 7 is the one honest
// program this will refuse, and refusing it is the same answer as for the

// shell, which is the prompt. A local PTY names the shell there instead, so
// its name is used only when the foreground group is not the shell's.
