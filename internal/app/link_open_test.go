// with no host or with localhost is this machine's, one with another host is

// Under `dartuios ssh` and `dartuios-web` the client process runs on the server. A
// browser opened from there opens on the server's console, in front of nobody,
// and the person who clicked sees nothing happen. dartuios has no way to run
// anything on the viewer's machine, so the honest action is the one that does
// reach it: OSC 52, which rides the same stream the frame does.
//
// The test asserts on the command rather than on a spawned process, because the
// bug it guards is that a process is spawned at all.

// remote client returns a nil command here (having tried to spawn a browser)
// and this fails.
