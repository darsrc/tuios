// Whether the host terminal can draw kitty Unicode placeholders.
//
// There is no way to ask it. The graphics protocol has a query action, but it
// answers for graphics as a whole and kitty's documentation offers nothing
// finer; the capability kitten's whole list is names, fonts, colours and the
// operating system, with nothing about images in it. The obvious probe does not
// work either: the specification says a virtual placement must carry c and r,
// so a terminal that implements placeholders ought to refuse one without them,
// but Ghostty answers OK to exactly that while supporting the feature, which
// makes a refusal-based probe a false negative. Every other client library
// reaches the same conclusion and guesses from the environment.
//
// So this asks the terminal who it is and looks the answer up. That is a
// heuristic, but it is a better one than reading TERM: XTVERSION is answered by
// the terminal on the other end of this tty, now, while TERM and TERM_PROGRAM
// are inherited environment variables that go stale and that a multiplexer
// rewrites.
//
// What keeps the heuristic honest is the direction it fails in. Placeholders
// are used only on a positive match, and everything else falls back to the
// placement path, which works on every kitty-graphics host. A table that is
// wrong or out of date therefore costs the nicer behaviour and never the
// picture.
