// Drawing the crash overlay.
//
// Every function here is a free function over a *CrashReport and a screen size.
// None of them takes an *OS, and that is not a style preference: this code runs
// after the model has failed, sometimes after the compositor itself has failed,
// so a read of the model here is a read of the thing under suspicion. The
// palette comes from theme.UI(), which is a package function with a full
// fallback ramp and no receiver, and the width comes from overlay.FitWidth,
// which is arithmetic. A nil report and a zero-sized screen both draw something
// rather than panic; see the tests.

// crashPanelWidth is the inner width the overlay would like. It holds a stack
// frame's file:line without wrapping on any screen wide enough to have shown
// dartuios in the first place, and FitWidth gives back what a narrower one can.

//
// It has one job, and it is not to explain the bug. Someone reading this has
// just had a program stop doing what they asked, and the first thing they need
// to know is whether they have lost anything. They have not: the panes are
// processes, the daemon holds the session, and a recovered panic drops one
// event or one frame. So the answer comes first, the offer to report comes
// second, and there is no apology, because an apology is a line of text between
// the user and the answer.
