// A pane already knows where its links are. The emulator records OSC 8 on every
// cell it paints, so the address of a marked link is a field read away, and a
// bare URL is found by reading one row of text. What the pane did not do until
// now is say so: a link looked like every other run of characters and a click on
// it selected text.
//
// This file is the "say so". It resolves the run of cells under the pointer into
// a PaneLink, and everything else in the feature reads that one value: the
// render loop underlines it, the pointer turns into a hand over it, the label
// names its target, and a click acts on it.
//
// It runs on arriving motion and nowhere else. A frame never calls it, so a pane
// that nobody is pointing at costs exactly what it cost before.

// PaneLink is the link under the pointer, in the coordinates the render loop
// draws in.
//
// The run is viewport-relative and inclusive at both ends, in row-major order:
// a cell (x, y) is inside it when it is at or after (X0, Y0) and at or before
// (X1, Y1). A marked link wraps across rows, which is why the run needs two
// corners rather than one row and two columns.
