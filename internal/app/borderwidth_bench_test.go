// What it costs to measure a box that has already been sized.
//
// A profile of the flood benchmark puts ansi.StringWidth at 43.75% cumulative,
// and one of the five passes over the content is dartuios's own: addToBorder
// opens with
//
//	width := max(lipgloss.Width(content)-2, 0)
//
// where content is the whole rendered box. lipgloss.Width walks every row
// through a grapheme-cluster iterator to find the widest one, so a 40-row pane
// pays 40 full-width scans of styled text, per pane, per frame, to recover a
// number the caller already holds: the same call takes *terminal.Window, whose
// Width is the box's width by construction.
//
// These two benchmarks are the same question asked twice: what the scan costs,
// and what knowing the answer costs. The gap is the size of the saving, and
// once the call site reads the width off the window instead, the ratio here is
// what proves it stayed fixed.
//
// The call site now passes window.ContentWidth(), and
// TestBorderBoxInnerWidthIsKnown below is the differential proof that the
// cheap answer is the measured one.

// TestBorderBoxInnerWidthIsKnown is what licenses addToBorder to be told its
// width instead of measuring one. It builds the border box exactly as
// renderWindowBox does and checks that the number the call site passes,
// window.ContentWidth(), is the number the scan would have returned.
//
// The matrix is the two things that could break the identity. Sizes go down to
// a one-column pane, where the content box clamps and the rendered box comes
// out wider than the pane itself; and every pre-shaped case is replayed,
// because a wide rune, a combining mark or a joined emoji is where a column
// count and a byte count part company. Both border-box paths run, since only
// one of them sets Width on the style and it is the other one whose width is
// implied by its content.
