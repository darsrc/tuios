// The deferred half of a resize, and the rule that it can never outlive the
// gesture that asked for it.
//
// A retile that happens while a resize is still in progress places panes
// directly and resizes them visually only, recording the real size in
// PendingResizes for later. That is right while the size is still moving: the
// expensive half (reallocating every emulator's backing store, TIOCSWINSZ,
// SIGWINCH, the daemon round trip, every guest's full repaint) costs more than
// a frame and the user is not finished choosing a size yet.
//
// It is wrong the moment the gesture ends, and a message marking that end
// (ViewportResizeSettledMsg for a terminal resize, mouse release for a drag)
// is not guaranteed to arrive. Update recovers panics and returns a nil
// command when it does, which drops the settle the same handler had just
// armed. The mouse release goes missing whenever the pointer leaves the
// surface the events come from mid-drag, which a browser client does every
// time. A flag cleared only by such a message stays set for the rest of the
// session, so every later retile (including the one a new window triggers)
// takes the visual-only branch and no pane gets its real size again.
//
// So the deferral is keyed on freshness instead. It holds only while a resize
// event has arrived recently; past that it expires by itself and drains the
// work it was holding. Nothing has to arrive for the layout to become correct
// again. The cost of expiring early during a genuine pause mid-gesture is one
// retile taking the full path, which is what it would have done anyway had the
// gesture ended there.

// resizeDeferralTimeout is how long after the last resize event the deferral
// still counts as live.
//
// Comfortably longer than viewportResizeSettleDelay, so the settle message
// remains the normal way a terminal resize ends and this only acts when that
// message never comes. Short enough that a lost mouse release is not something
// the user has to notice: the next retile after half a second is a real one.
