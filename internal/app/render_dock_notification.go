// The message block that lives in the dock's right-hand end.
//
// The placement is the whole point: a message belongs to the bar and never
// covers a pane. The corner toast this replaces was drawn as a layer on top of
// the workspace, three rows tall, and landed exactly where a freshly split
// pane's first output goes.
//
// The block wears no fill. It used to sit on the chrome's Surface step, and
// that slab was the largest ink object in the bar while the words inside it
// were the information: structure drawn at the weight of content, the same
// shape of problem the rail's edges had. The bar's own ground does the job for
// free, and it does it better for the marks, which no longer have to be lifted
// toward the text colour to clear the mark floor on a raised grey: info blue
// measures 3.16:1 on the bare canvas against 2.20:1 on the old fill, so
// dropping the slab bought back the hue. What separates the message from the
// dock items beside it is that they are filled pills and it is not, plus the
// cap on its left and the lit rule above its span.
//
// The cap is a freestanding partial block in the severity's ink, two eighths
// for info and success, four for a warning, six for an error. The weight is a
// channel that survives greyscale and a theme with no contrast to spare, which
// colour alone does not, and the sliver doubles as the block's opening edge.
//
// Naming goes to the mark, a Nerd Font severity glyph in the severity colour
// rather than knocked out of a coloured chip, so the message itself is never
// on a coloured ground and stays as legible as the rest of the dock.
//
// Time is carried by the dock's own hairline, one row above: it lights in the
// severity colour across exactly the block's span and burns down from the right
// as the message ages. A sticky error lights it end to end and stops, so "not
// moving" is the affordance that it is waiting for you.

// notifBlock is a rendered message: the dock's right-hand block, and the run of
// hairline that goes above it. They are produced together because the rule's
// length is defined as the block's span, and the two drifting apart is exactly
// the sort of thing that only shows up on screen.

// burns down as it ages. But the rule moves one cell at a time, so over a
// message's life it changes about as many times as the block is wide, and a
// compose on every tick drew the same frame dozens of times per visible
// change. Nothing else in the block moves on its own: the text, the mark and
// the meta are fixed per message and queue, and a message arriving, leaving or
// being dismissed changes the top message or the count.
