## Negative controls

A test that has never been seen to fail is not evidence. For each test you
added, break the thing it covers and paste the failure it prints.

Two rules, from three green suites that hid three real defects. See
`e2e/tui/NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md`.

- [ ] **The control deletes the call site, not the function.** Cut the `case`,
      the `Register`, the route or the gate line. A control on the function
      proves the test and the function match. It does not prove anything calls
      the function.
- [ ] **Every negative test has its positive half.** A test that asserts "X does
      not happen when Y" also asserts, in the same fixture, "X happens when not
      Y". Without it, the test may never have reached Y.

Control run:
- Wiring cut: `<file:line, what you removed>`
- Test that failed: `<name, and the message it printed>`
