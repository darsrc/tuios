# Records assets/demo.gif for the README.
#
#   assets/record-demo.sh          # uses the dartuios first on $PATH
#
# The preparation has to happen out here rather than inside the tape. vhs
# applies a tape's Env from the very first frame, so its shell starts with
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME already pointing at a directory that does not exist yet, and
# fish creates it and writes a default config into it before any Type command
# could build the real thing.
#
# What it builds:
#
#   A scratch XDG root, because [startup] daemon is on by default and a
#   recording made against the real one attaches to the daemon the person
#   recording is working in, films their panes, and leaves its own behind.
#
#   A config directory of symlinks to the real one, with dartuios replaced by a
#   copy. The session then looks like the machine it was recorded on - the same
#   shell, prompt and fastfetch - while the theme applied at the end of the
#   tape, which dartuios persists, lands in the copy instead of the real config.
