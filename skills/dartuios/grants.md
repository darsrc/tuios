# Pane grants: what a pane may do

Every pane holds grants that say what a process in it may do through dartuios. The
daemon checks every call from a pane against them before anything runs: the
CLI, a script on the socket, `dartuios mcp` and the tmux shim alike. The person's
own shell and client, outside every pane, are held to nothing new.

```sh
dartuios pane-grants
dartuios pane-grants --json | jq -r '.grants | join(",")'
```

| Grant | What it lets you do |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | Read your own session and your fan group: list, `get-window`, capture, agent state, waits, the event stream, mail |
| `write` | Type into the panes of your own session that hold nothing you do not, and leave mail and stashed files there |
| `fan` | Write in your fan group and the sessions you launched, and start agents with `fan` and `start-agent` |
| `respond` | Answer another pane's prompt with `respond`, for the person, and type into a pane waiting on a prompt |
| `admin` | Everything else: other sessions, listings across sessions, windows, layouts, options, `kill-session`, `run-command`, attach. Includes `read`, `write` and `fan`, never `respond` |

Whatever you hold, you can report about your own pane (`set-agent-state`,
`set-agent-meta`, `set-agent-session`, `ask-human`, `request-approval`) and ask
what you hold. So `dartuios agent-hook` works in every pane.

`DARTUIOS_PANE_GRANTS` is what the pane held when its process started;
`dartuios pane-grants` is what it holds now.

## Typing into another pane

What you type into a pane runs with that pane's grants. So without `admin`,
typing into any pane but your own (`send-text`, `send-keys`, `run`,
`ask-agent`, `queue`) is refused when the target holds a grant you do not, and
when the target is on `needs_input` unless you hold `respond`, because keys
typed there answer its prompt. A message you queue is checked against your
grants again when it is typed, and dropped if they no longer cover the
target. Your keys always go to the target's terminal, never to the
window manager.

## A refusal

A call your grants do not cover does nothing and answers `forbidden`, with a
hint naming the grant it needed, what you hold and where that came from:

```
send-text is refused for this pane: writing into the pane's own session needs the write grant
```

That is the person's decision. Do the work inside what you hold, or ask the
person (`dartuios ask-human`, or mail to `human`). Do not look for another verb or
process that does the same thing, and do not try to raise your own grants: you
cannot, and trying says the wrong thing about what you are doing. From a pane
without `admin`, a call that names no session means your own session.

## Where grants come from

- `--grants` when the pane was started: `dartuios start-agent`, `dartuios fan` and
  `dartuios new-window` take it.
- Or `dartuios set-pane-grants` later.
- Or else the default of `[agents.permissions]` in config.toml: `admin` under
  `mode = "open"` (the default), and the `grants` list under `mode = "strict"`
  (`read`, `write` and `fan` when unset).

A pane can never give more than it holds. A pane without `admin` that starts an
agent without `--grants` gives it its own grants. A pane changes only its own
grants unless it holds `admin`, and `admin` cannot give `respond`, so `respond`
comes only from the person.

## Giving a helper less

```sh
dartuios start-agent claude --name reviewer --grants read
dartuios fan 3 --agent codex --grants read,write 'Add a retry with backoff.'
dartuios new-window -s work sandbox --grants read,write
dartuios set-pane-grants -w reviewer --grants read
dartuios set-pane-grants -w reviewer --reset
```

To drop your own pane's grants before you start an agent in it:

```sh
dartuios set-pane-grants --grants read,write && exec claude
```

A supervisor the person trusts to approve its workers' tool calls is the one
pane that should hold `respond`, and the person gives it:

```sh
dartuios set-pane-grants -w supervisor --grants read,write,fan,respond
```

The grants are saved with the window, so a restored pane holds what it held.
`list-windows --json` shows `grants` on every pane given its own.

## How the daemon knows the pane

The daemon places a caller by the kernel's record of its pid. Where the kernel
cannot say (Windows, the BSDs), the CLI presents `DARTUIOS_PANE_ID` and
`DARTUIOS_PANE_TOKEN` on every connection, and the daemon holds the connection to
the pane the token proves. You never pass either by hand.

Grants scope accidents and prompt-injected agents that use dartuios the ordinary
way. They are not a sandbox: a process that leaves its pane on purpose is not
placed in it. What your process may do to files and other programs is the
operating system's business.
