// Package applist enumerates the programs a launcher can run.
//
// There are two sources. $PATH is the set a shell would run, and a launcher
// that disagrees with the shell is lying about what typing a name will do.
// .desktop files are the set the user's desktop already offers, and they carry
// what a $PATH listing cannot: the name a person knows the program by, an
// icon, a line of description, and an argv that may hold arguments the
// basename never reveals.
//
// Merge folds the second source into the first and returns the one list a
// launcher ranks. Entry stays source-agnostic so both halves go through the
// same matcher, and so a caller with a third source can join them the same
// way.

// SourcePath names the $PATH source on an Entry and SourceDesktop the
// .desktop one, so a merged row can say where it came from.
//
// Why both are in one list is worth writing down, because the obvious way to
// do it is wrong. Almost every desktop entry's Exec is a program already on
// $PATH, so appending one source to the other puts the same program in the
// list twice under two names. The palette's whole job is that the right row is
// first, and near-synonyms work directly against that. Merge's supersession
// rule is what buys the human name and the icon without paying that price: a
// desktop entry that runs a $PATH program replaces that program's row instead
// of sitting next to it.
//
// A correct reading of a .desktop file is not small: Exec field codes, TryExec,
// NoDisplay, Hidden, OnlyShowIn, localised Name keys and Actions. Half of that
// produces rows that fail when activated, which is worse than a row that is not
// there. desktop.go implements the whole of it and drops what it cannot honour,
// so a merged row is one that runs.
//
// Desktop entries are Linux and BSD only, which is why that half of the package
// is unix-only and Merge does not exist elsewhere. $PATH means the same thing on
// every platform dartuios builds for, so a Windows list is the $PATH list and stays
// as explicable as it was.
//
// One property of a desktop entry is dartuios-specific: Terminal=true declares that
// the program must run inside a terminal emulator. dartuios is one, so those are
// entries it hosts natively where a GUI launcher has to spawn a terminal first.
