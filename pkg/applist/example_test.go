// Example shows the whole launcher pipeline: scan once and keep the cache,
// rank with the shared matcher on every keystroke, lift what the user actually
// runs, and record the choice.

// The two packages are split at the point a caller would want to substitute
// something: applist knows what can be run, fuzzy knows how to order it, and
// neither knows how the rows are drawn.

	// does filesystem I/O, so it belongs off whatever goroutine draws.

	// orders near-ties without overruling a clearly better match.

// means: the first directory on $PATH wins, exactly as the shell resolves it.
