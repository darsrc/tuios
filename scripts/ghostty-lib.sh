# Build the static libghostty-vt that the ghostty build tag links against.
#
# Usage: scripts/ghostty-lib.sh [target]
#   target: zig target triple (default: native). Examples:
#     x86_64-linux-gnu, aarch64-linux-gnu, x86_64-macos, aarch64-macos,
#     x86_64-windows-gnu, aarch64-windows-gnu
#
# Output: .ghostty-vt/<target>/{lib,include,pkgconfig}. Point PKG_CONFIG_PATH
# at the pkgconfig dir and build dartuios with -tags ghostty.
#
# The pkgconfig file is rewritten rather than taken from the ghostty build:
# upstream emits the bare library path in Libs:, which Go's cgo flag
# allowlist rejects, and names the windows archive ghostty-vt-static.lib,
# which -l cannot find. Both are fixed by installing as libghostty-vt.a and
# emitting -L/-l flags.
set -eu

# Pinned because the ghostty tag is a release artifact: the emulator must not
# drift under a release without a deliberate bump here.
#
# Bump go.mitchellh.com/libghostty in go.mod in the same change. The binding
# compiles against these headers and calls into this archive, so the two pins
# must move together. A binding built for older headers still compiles against
# newer ones, and the mismatch is silent.

# The archive outlives the machine that built it: CI restores it from a cache
# shared by heterogeneous runners, and release binaries link it and then run on
# whatever a user has. A native build bakes in the builder's CPU, so an archive
# built where AVX-512 exists dies with SIGILL where it does not. Baseline is
# the only portable answer. Cross targets already resolve to baseline; saying
# it once covers native too.
